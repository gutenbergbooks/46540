<h1>ELSIE'S WINTER TRIP.</h1>



<p class="ph2">CHAPTER I.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">"Lu</span>, dear, can you give me an early breakfast
to-morrow morning?" asked Chester, as
they made their preparations for retiring
that first night in their new home.</p>

<p>"I think so," she returned, giving him an
affectionate look and smile. "How early
would you like to have it?"</p>

<p>"About seven, I think. I have told our
coachman, Jack, that I want the carriage at
eight. He will drive me into town and then
return, so that carriage and horses will be
ready at a reasonably early hour for the other
three owners&mdash;our brother and sister and
yourself."</p>

<p>"It was certainly very kind and thoughtful
in you to give such an order," she said
with a smile, "but we would much prefer to
have your company in all our drives and
visits."</p>

<p>"And I should very much like to give it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
you; but there is business that should have
been attended to some time ago, and must
not be longer delayed."</p>

<p>"If it is, it shall not be your wife's fault,"
she replied. "The cook is still in the kitchen,
and I will go and give my order for a seven-o'clock
breakfast."</p>

<p>"Lu, dear," Chester said, on her return,
"it will not be at all necessary for you to rise
in time for so early a breakfast, I can pour
my own coffee and eat alone."</p>

<p>"No, you can't have that privilege while
I'm your wife;" she responded, with a saucy
look and smile. "I intend to pour your coffee,
and see that you have an appetizing
breakfast and do justice to it."</p>

<p>"Your presence will make it doubly enjoyable,
dearest," he returned, putting an arm
about her, and giving her a look of loving
admiration, "but you must not be robbed of
needed rest and sleep."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear husband," she replied;
"but I am accustomed to early rising
and it agrees with me. Oh, I think I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
greatly enjoy taking early breakfast with
you. Isn't it delightful to begin our married
life in so lovely a home of our very own?"</p>

<p>"It is, indeed! and we owe it to your good,
kind, and most generous father."</p>

<p>"He is that, most emphatically," responded
Lucilla. "The dearest, best, and
kindest father in the world."</p>

<p>Seven o'clock the next morning found
them cosily seated at a little round table in
their pretty dining-room, enjoying a delicious
breakfast of fresh fruits, broiled fowl,
hot muffins and coffee. These, added to good
health, cheerful spirits, and a fondness for
each other's society, made them a happy
couple.</p>

<p>The meal was enlivened with cheerful chat.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you have to hurry so," Lucilla
said, as she filled her husband's cup for
the second time. "I really think you ought
to have at least a little longer holiday."</p>

<p>"I expect to take it piecemeal, nights and
mornings, in the society of my wife," returned
Chester, with affectionate look and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
smile. "I was very glad to get this case," he
added, "for if I succeed with it it will bring
me in some thousands."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad of that for your sake,"
said Lucilla; "but don't work too hard. You
know you are not very strong; therefore you
need to take good care of yourself."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear, be careful how you encourage
me in self-indulgence," laughed
Chester. "I am too much inclined that
way as it is."</p>

<p>"Are you?" she exclaimed with mirthful
look and tone. "I really had not found it
out, but thought you one of the foolishly industrious
people who will even throw away
health in order to get on rapidly with their
work."</p>

<p>"And I," laughed Chester, "took you for
a woman of such discernment that you must
have found out before this what a lazy, incompetent
fellow you have thrown yourself
away upon."</p>

<p>"No; with all my discernment I have yet
to make that discovery. I did not marry the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
fellow yon describe&mdash;but a bright, talented,
industrious young man. And I wont have
him slandered."</p>

<p>At that moment a servant came in with
the announcement that the carriage was at
the door.</p>

<p>"Ah! Jack is quite punctual, and I am
just ready," said Chester, pushing back his
chair, getting up and going round to his
wife's side of the table. "I will now take
away the slanderer of your bright, talented,
industrious young man," he remarked in
sportive tone; "you shall be relieved of his
presence until perhaps five o'clock this afternoon."</p>

<p>Before he had finished, Lucilla was standing
by his side, her hand in his.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I wish you didn't have to go,"
she sighed. "We have been together all the
time for weeks past and now I hardly know
how I can do without you."</p>

<p>"Suppose you come along then. There is
plenty of room in the carriage, and in the
office, and I could find you something to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
read, or some work on the typewriter, if you
prefer that."</p>

<p>"Any time that I am needed there I shall
be ready to go," she returned with merry
look and tone; "but to-day I have matters to
attend to about the house, and perhaps father
and Mamma Vi may want some little assistance
from me in their preparations for to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes, I daresay. What a round of parties
we are likely to have to go through as part of
the penalty for venturing into the state of
matrimony."</p>

<p>"Yes," laughed Lucilla, "but I hope you
think it pays."</p>

<p>"Most assuredly. But now good-bye, dearest,
for some hours&mdash;when we shall have the
pleasure of meeting to atone to us for the
present pain of parting." Lucilla followed
him to the veranda, where they exchanged a
parting caress, then watched as he entered
the carriage and it drove swiftly through the
grounds and out into the highway. Her eyes
were still following it when a pleasant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
manly voice near at hand said "Good morning
Mrs. Dinsmore."</p>

<p>She turned quickly and sprang down the
steps to meet the speaker.</p>

<p>"Father, dear father!" she cried, springing
into his outstretched arms, and putting
hers about his neck, "Oh, how glad I am to
see you! How good in you to come! Chester
has just done eating his breakfast and gone
off to his business, and I haven't quite finished
my meal. Wont you come in and eat
with me?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that would hardly do, daughter,"
was the smiling reply. "You know I am expected
to take that meal with wife and children
at Woodburn. But I will go in with
you and we will have a chat while you finish
your breakfast."</p>

<p>"And you can take a cup of coffee and a
little fruit, can't you, father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you, daughter. That would
hardly interfere with the Woodburn breakfast.
And shall we not take a little stroll
about your grounds when we leave the breakfast-room?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should greatly enjoy doing so along
with my dear father," she answered with a
smiling look up into his face, as they took
their places at the inviting-looking table. She
poured his coffee, then they ate and chatted
pleasantly the while about family matters
and the entertainment to be given at Woodburn
that evening.</p>

<p>"How are Max and Eva this morning?"
the Captain asked at length.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether they are up yet or
not," replied Lucilla. "You know, papa,
they had not the same occasion for early rising
that Chester and I had."</p>

<p>"True enough and Max is fully entitled to
take his ease for the present. Don't you
think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, papa. I am very glad the
dear fellow is having a good holiday after all
he has gone through. Oh, I wish he had
chosen some business that would allow him
to stay at home with us!"</p>

<p>"That would be pleasanter for us, but our
country must have a navy and officers to command
it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and so it is well that some men
fancy that kind of life and employment."</p>

<p>"And no doubt Max inherits the taste for
a seafaring life from me and my forebears."</p>

<p>"Father," said Lulu, "you will let me be
your amanuensis again, will you not?"</p>

<p>"Thank you for your willingness to serve
me in that, daughter," the Captain returned
pleasantly, "but you will find quite enough
to do here in your own house, and both your
Mamma Vi and your Sister Grace have
taken up your work in that line&mdash;sometimes
one and sometimes the other following my
dictation upon the typewriter."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am glad that they can and will, for
your sake, father, but I hope I shall be permitted
to do a little of my old work for you
once in a while."</p>

<p>"That is altogether likely," he said. "But
now as we have finished eating and drinking
shall we not take our stroll about the
grounds?"</p>

<p>They did so, chatting pleasantly as was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
their wont; then returning to the veranda
they found Max and Evelyn there.</p>

<p>Morning greetings were exchanged, then
Evelyn, saying that their breakfast was just
ready, invited the Captain to come in and
share it. But he declined, giving the same
reason as before to Lucilla's invitation.</p>

<p>"I am going home now to breakfast with
wife and children," he said, "and I hope you
older ones of my flock will join us a little
later."</p>

<p>"We will all be glad to do that, father,"
said Max. "At least I can speak for myself
and think I can for these two daughters of
yours. Woodburn is to me a dear old home
where some of the happiest hours of my life
have been spent."</p>

<p>"And you can't love it much better than
Lu and I do," added Evelyn.</p>

<p>"No, he can't," assented Lucilla. "Lovely
as is this Sunnyside of ours, its chief attraction
to me is its near neighborhood to
Woodburn&mdash;the home where I have passed
such happy years under my father's loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
care." The bright, dark eyes she lifted to
his face as she spoke were full of daughterly
love and reverence.</p>

<p>"I am very glad you can look back upon
them as happy years, daughter," he said, his
eyes shining with pleasure and parental affection;
"and that Max is with you in that.
I am glad, too, that you all appreciate this
new home that I have taken so much pleasure
in preparing for you."</p>

<p>"We'd be the basest of ingrates, if we
didn't, father dear!" exclaimed Lucilla. "I
for one, feel that you have done, and are doing
far more for me than I deserve."</p>

<p>"Which is nothing new for our father,"
remarked Max with a smile and look into his
father's face that spoke volumes of filial regard,
respect and devotion.</p>

<p>"And I am fortunate indeed in having
children so dutiful, affectionate and appreciative,"
returned the Captain feelingly.</p>

<p>He then took leave and went back to
Woodburn, Lucilla accompanying him part
of the way, then returning to Sunnyside to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
give her orders for the day. That attended
to, she joined Max and Eva upon the
veranda.</p>

<p>"The carriage is coming, Lu," said Eva;
"are you ready for a drive? and have you
decided where you wish to go?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply, "I want to go over
to Woodburn for a bit of a chat with Mamma
Vi about the preparations for this evening,
in which I suppose you and Max will join
me; and then wouldn't you like to drive over
to Fairview for a call upon Aunt Elsie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! I think she and uncle are
entitled to the first call from me, much as I
want to see all the near and dear ones."</p>

<p>"I perfectly agree with you in that, Eva,"
said Max. "They have filled the place of
parents to you, and I for one," he added with
a very loverlike smile, "am grateful to them
for it."</p>

<p>"As I am with still more reason," added
Evelyn.</p>

<p>A few moments later found them on their
way to Woodburn. There was a glad welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
there followed by a few minutes' lively
chat, principally in regard to the coming
event of the evening&mdash;the expected gathering
of invited guests, relatives, neighbours
and friends to welcome the return of the
newly-married couples from their bridal
trip.</p>

<p>"Is there anything I can do to help with
your preparations, Mamma Vi?" asked Lucilla.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Lu, but they are almost all
made now, except what the servants will do,"
returned Violet, adding laughingly. "And
if they were not, it would surely hardly be
the correct thing to let one of our brides be
at the trouble of assisting with them."</p>

<p>"Both of them would be very glad to give
their help, if it were desired or needed," said
Evelyn. "We feel privileged to offer assistance,
because it is our father's house," she
concluded with a smiling, affectionate look
at the Captain.</p>

<p>"That is right, daughter," he said, both
his tone and the expression of his countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
showing that he was pleased with her
remark.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lu, I have been making some
changes in the rooms that were yours, but are
mine now," said Grace. "Papa has provided
some new pieces of furniture both there and
in our little sitting-room and I want to show
them to you, Eva and Max." She rose as
she spoke, the others following her example.</p>

<p>"Are the rest of us invited, Gracie?" asked
Violet, in an amused tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed!" was the gay rejoinder,
"father and you, Elsie and Ned. Company
that is always acceptable to me wherever I
go."</p>

<p>"And to all of us," added Lucilla.</p>

<p>"Most especially so to one who has often
sighed in vain for it," said Max.</p>

<p>"Have you wanted us sometimes when you
were far away on the sea, Brother Max?"
asked Ned with a look of loving sympathy
up into his brother's face.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, Ned; and expect to do so
again before very long."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>They were passing through the hall and
up the stairway as they talked.</p>

<p>"Oh, the dear old rooms look lovely,
lovely!" exclaimed Lucilla, as they passed
into the little sitting-room she had formerly
shared with her sister Grace, glanced around
it and through the open doors into the two
bedrooms. "It almost makes me homesick to
be living in them again."</p>

<p>"Well, daughter, you may come back
whenever you choose," her father said, with
a look of mingled amusement and affection.</p>

<p>"Why, Lu, I thought you loved that pretty
new home papa has taken such pains to make
ready for you and Eva and Max and Chester,"
exclaimed Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes, so I do; but this old home has the
added charm of being papa's also."</p>

<p>"Yes; but the other is so near that you can
see him every day, and oftener, if you
choose."</p>

<p>"And talk to him at any moment through
the telephone, if she prefers that to coming
over here," said the Captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes! how nice it is that our houses
are all connected by telephone," exclaimed
Evelyn. "Father, if I may, I think I'll go
to yours and speak to Aunt Elsie now."</p>

<p>"Certainly, daughter," he returned,
promptly leading the way.</p>

<p>"I do so like that name from you, father
dear," she said softly and smiling up into his
face as they reached the instrument.</p>

<p>"And I am glad my boy Max has given me
the right," he returned, bending down to kiss
the ruby lips and smooth the shining hair.</p>

<p>"Shall I ring and call for you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"If you please."</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Leland who answered it.</p>

<p>"Hello, what is it?"</p>

<p>"It is I, Aunt Elsie," returned Evelyn.
"I just called to know if you were in; because
if you are, we are coming over directly
to make you a call."</p>

<p>"I think I shall be by the time you can get
here," was the reply in a tone of amusement.
"But please don't delay, as we were about to
start for Sunnyside in a few minutes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, were you! Then we will drive over
at once and accompany you on the trip."</p>

<p>"Thank you; that will be most pleasant."</p>

<p>Eva stepped aside and Lucilla took her
place.</p>

<p>"Yes, Aunt Elsie, you will be a most welcome
visitor in both divisions of Sunnyside.
Please don't neglect mine."</p>

<p>"I certainly do not intend to," was the
cheerily-spoken response, "for your half of
the dwelling is doubtless quite as well worth
seeing as the other, and its occupants seem
very near and dear."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Good-bye now till we arrive
at Fairview."</p>

<p>"We would better start for that place
presently," said Max. "We can view the
beauties of this any day. Wont you go with
us, Grace? There is a vacant seat in the
carriage."</p>

<p>"Yes, do; we'd be glad to have you,"
urged both Eva and Lucilla, the latter adding,
"You have hardly yet taken a look at
our new homes with us in them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, go, daughter; I think you will enjoy
it," her father said in reply to a questioning
glance from her beautiful blue eyes, directed
to him.</p>

<p>"Thank you all three," she said. "I will
go if I may have ten minutes in which to get
ready."</p>

<p>"Fifteen, if necessary," replied Max, in
sportive tone. "Even that great loss of time
will be well paid for by the pleasure of your
good company."</p>

<p>"A well-turned compliment, brother
mine," returned Grace, as she tripped away
in search of hat and wrap; for the air was
cool in driving.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't Elsie go too? There is
plenty of room for her; and Ned can ride
alongside on his pony, which I see is down
yonder ready saddled and bridled," said
Max, putting an arm round his little sister,
as she stood by his side, and looking smilingly
at her, then at Ned. "Can't they go,
father and Mamma Vi?"</p>

<p>Both parents gave a ready consent, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
children were delighted with the invitation,
and presently the party set out on their way
to Fairview.</p>

<p>It was a short and pleasant drive, and they
were greeted with a joyous welcome on their
arrival at Evelyn's old home, Mr. and Mrs.
Leland and their four children meeting them
on the veranda with smiles, pleasant words
and caresses for Grace, Eva, Lucilla and
Elsie. Then they were taken within and to
the dining-room, where a delicate and appetizing
lunch was awaiting them.</p>

<p>"It is a little early for lunch," said Mrs.
Leland, "but we knew you would be wanting
to get back to Sunnyside soon, in order not
to miss the numerous calls about to be made
you by friends and connections who are all
anxious to see the pretty new home and its
loved occupants."</p>

<p>"We will be glad to see them, Aunt Elsie,"
said Evelyn, "and to show our lovely homes;
and I can assure you that no one can be more
welcome there than you and uncle and these
dear cousins of mine."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"And please understand that Eva has expressed
my sentiments as fully as her own,"
added Lucilla in a sprightly tone.</p>

<p>"Mine also," said Max.</p>

<p>"But don't any one of you feel that this
meal is to be taken in haste," said Mr. Leland,
hospitably, "that is very bad for digestion
and we may take plenty of time, even at
the risk of having some of your callers get to
Sunnyside ahead of us."</p>

<p>His advice was taken and much pleasant
chat indulged in while they ate.</p>

<p>"You and uncle, of course, expect to be
at Woodburn to-night, Aunt Elsie?" said
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; and expect to have you all here
to-morrow night. There is to be quite a
round of parties&mdash;as doubtless you know&mdash;to
celebrate the great event of your and Lu's
entrance into the bonds of matrimony. There
will be none Saturday night, but the round
will begin again Monday evening by a party
at Ion given by mamma, Edward and Zoe.
Tuesday evening we are all to go to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Oaks; then after that will be the Laurel's,
Roselands, Beechwood, Pinegrove, Ashlands
and others."</p>

<p>"Don't forget Aunt Rosie's at Riverside,
mamma," prompted Allie, her nine-year-old
daughter.</p>

<p>"No," returned her mother, "that would be
quite too bad, for there is no one more ready
to do honor to these dear friends of ours;
especially now when they have just begun
married life."</p>

<p>"Ah, Aunt Elsie, that sounds as though
you considered it something to one's credit
to have left a life of single blessedness for
one in the married state," laughed Lucilla.</p>

<p>"A state which I have found so pleasant
that I think no one deserves any credit for
entering it," was Mrs. Leland's smiling rejoinder.</p>

<p>"And I have noticed," said Max, "that as
a rule those who have tried it once are very
ready to try it again&mdash;widows and widowers
seem in more haste to marry than bachelors
and maids."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Marry in haste and repent at leisure,'"
quoted Grace, laughingly. "Father takes
care that his children don't do the first, perhaps
to secure them from the second."</p>

<p>"And we all have great confidence in our
father's wisdom; as well as his strong affection
for us, his children," remarked Max.</p>

<p>A sentiment which the others&mdash;his wife
and sisters&mdash;promptly and cordially endorsed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Immediately</span> on leaving the table, they
all&mdash;entertainers and entertained&mdash;set out
on the short drive to Sunnyside, where, on
arriving, they found their relatives and
friends from Beechwood and the Oaks waiting
to offer their congratulations and wish
them happiness and prosperity in their married
life.</p>

<p>Being all acquaintances and friends of so
long standing, they were shown over the
whole house by the happy owners, and cordial
congratulations were freely bestowed.</p>

<p>"In view of the comforts, conveniences
and beauties of the establishment, I should
like to see Chester and offer my congratulations
on his success in winning a lovely wife,
and having so delightful a home to share
with her," remarked Mrs. Horace Dinsmore,
as she was about leaving. "But I can't stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
longer if I am to make due preparation for
attending the party at Woodburn to-night,"
she added.</p>

<p>"And you wouldn't miss that for something,
would you?" laughed Mrs. Hugh Lilburn.
"I am sure I wouldn't."</p>

<p>"No; for I daresay we will have a delightful
time. I know no better entertainers than
the Captain and Vi."</p>

<p>"Nor do I," said Mrs. Leland; "and this
being so extra an occasion they will doubtless
do their best."</p>

<p>"I think they will, and I hope no invited
guest will stay away or be disappointed,"
said Grace, with a merry look and smile.</p>

<p>"No danger of either calamity, Gracie,"
said Mrs. Dinsmore. "Ah, there's our carriage
at the door," and with a hasty good-bye
and a cordial invitation to all present to
make frequent visits at the Oaks, she and her
husband and daughter departed.</p>

<p>The Beechwood friends lingered a little
longer, as did those from Fairview and
Woodburn. But at length Grace said she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
thought it time to go home for, of course,
there were some matters she ought to attend
to in preparation for the evening.</p>

<p>"Shall I send you in the carriage?" asked
Lucilla.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, thank you, sister dear; the short
walk will be good for me," returned Grace
gaily, "for Elsie, too, I think, and for Ned;
though he, I suppose, will prefer to ride his
pony."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I will," said Ned. "He
needs to be taken home, anyway."</p>

<p>They made their adieus and passed out on
the veranda.</p>

<p>A servant brought the pony up, and Ned
was about to mount when the little steed remarked,
"I think a young gentleman might
feel ashamed to ride while his lady sisters
must go afoot."</p>

<p>"You do!" exclaimed Ned, drawing back
with a look of mingled surprise and chagrin.
"Well, they said they wanted to walk&mdash;preferred
it to riding; and&mdash;and besides they
couldn't both ride on your back at once."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Two do ride the same horse at once sometimes,"
seemed to come very distinctly from
the pony's lips.</p>

<p>"Who is making you talk, I wonder?"
cried Ned, turning to look about him. "Oh,
Brother Max, it was you, wasn't it?" as he
caught sight of his brother and sisters standing
near.</p>

<p>"What was?" asked Max quietly.</p>

<p>"The person making the pony talk. I almost
thought for a minute it really was the
pony; though, of course, ponies can't talk.
And I didn't mean to be selfish. Gracie
won't you ride him home? Elsie and I can
walk just as well as not."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course we can; it's a very short
and very pleasant walk," returned Elsie,
with prompt cheerfulness. "So Gracie dear,
you ride the pony."</p>

<p>"Thank you both," said Grace, "but I
really prefer to walk, as I have had very
little exercise to-day."</p>

<p>"There, you silly little pony, see what a
mistake you made!" cried Ned gleefully, as
he mounted his steed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, little master, didn't you make a
mistake, too?" the pony seemed to ask.</p>

<p>"Oh, Brother Max, I know it's you, so
only good fun," laughed Ned. "Good-bye
all. I'll get home first and tell papa and
mamma you are coming, Gracie and Elsie."</p>

<p>With the last words, he galloped down the
avenue, leaving Max and his sisters standing
on the veranda looking after him.</p>

<p>"Doesn't he ride well?" exclaimed Grace,
in a tone that spoke much sisterly pride and
affection. The others gave a hearty assent,
Max adding, "He is a dear little, bright little
chap. I am decidedly proud of my only
brother."</p>

<p>"As I am of my little one; but still more
so of my older one," said Lucilla. "But I
must go back to my remaining guests. Good-bye,
my two dear sisters. I shall expect and
hope to see you both over here every day."</p>

<p>"It is very likely you will see us here at
least that often," laughed Grace, "and we
will expect an honest return of each and
every visit."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll get it, too," cried Elsie; "Lu
could never stay away a whole day from
papa."</p>

<p>"It would certainly take very strong compulsion
to make me do so," said Lucilla.
"Good-bye again. I hope to see you both in
my old home a few hours hence, and here
some time to-morrow."</p>

<p>With that she passed into the house while
her sisters hastened away in the direction of
Woodburn.</p>

<p>"It will soon be time to send the carriage
for Chester," said Max, accompanying her,
"Suppose I give the order now."</p>

<p>"Yes, do," she replied, "I'd like to have
him here as soon as possible; and if he
should not be quite ready, Jack and the carriage
can be kept waiting."</p>

<p>"Certainly. I'll go and give the order,
then rejoin you and our guests in the drawing-room."</p>

<p>As Max stepped out upon the veranda
again two carriages came driving up the
avenue&mdash;one bringing Mr. and Mrs. Lacey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
from the Laurels, the other Mr. and Mrs.
Croly from Riverside.</p>

<p>"Oh, Max, how glad I am to see you
again!" exclaimed Rosie, as he assisted her
to alight. "It seems an age since you went
away, and you have been exposed to such
perils I hope I shall have a chance to hear
the story of your experiences in that fight at
Manila. Such a chance as I couldn't get at
any of the late parties."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I hope we will have time and
opportunity for a number of talks," he replied,
releasing the hand she had put into
his and turning to greet Mrs. Lacey, whom
he addressed as Aunt Rose, and whose greeting
was quite as cordial as her niece's had
been.</p>

<p>"You have the Fairview and Beechwood
folks here now I see," remarked Mrs. Croly,
glancing toward their waiting vehicles.</p>

<p>"Yes; walk in and let us have you all together,"
returned Max. "We will make a
small party in anticipation of the large one
to be held at Woodburn some hours hence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," assented Rosie, "we are all relatives
and friends, and I for one can never see
too much of Sister Elsie or Cousin Ronald,
to speak of only one of each family."</p>

<p>Hearty greetings were exchanged, a short
time spent in cheerful chat, then one set of
visitors after another took their departure
till at length Max, Evelyn and Lucilla were
left alone, though looking almost momentarily
for Chester's homecoming.</p>

<p>"It has probably been a hard day with
him. I fear he will be too weary for much
enjoyment to-night," sighed Lucilla.</p>

<p>"I hope not," said Max. "The meeting
with so many relatives and friends will probably
be restful. Ah, there's the carriage
now, just coming up the driveway."</p>

<p>It brought Chester, and he showed himself
to be in excellent spirits, though somewhat
weary with the labors of the day. He reported
that all seemed to be going right with
the business in hand, and he had little doubt
that he should gain his hoped-for reward.
His audience of three listened with keen interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to all he had to say. When he had finished
Eva rose saying, "I must go now and
attend to housekeeping matters so that Max
and I may be ready in good season for our
Woodburn festivities."</p>

<p>"Stay, Eva," said Lucilla, "I have ordered
an early light tea for the four of us. We
wont want a very hearty meal to spoil our appetites
for the refreshments to be served at
Woodburn."</p>

<p>"No, certainly not; it is very kind in you
to provide for us as well as for yourselves,"
returned Evelyn; Max adding, "It is, indeed,
sister mine."</p>

<p>"Well, really," laughed Lucilla, "it was
for my own pleasure quite as much as for
yours." And tears came into the eyes gazing
with sisterly affection into those of Max. "I
want to entertain you while I can," she
added, "for there is no knowing when Uncle
Sam may be ordering you quite out of
reach."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't let us talk of that!" exclaimed
Eva. "Let us banish it from our thoughts for
the present."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is good advice," said Max, his voice
a trifle husky; "it's what I'm trying to do for
the present; for however much a man may
love the service&mdash;a little wife such as mine
must be far nearer and dearer."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Chester; "if you had only
chosen the law, we might now be partners in
my office, as well as in this house."</p>

<p>"And I perhaps might ruin the business
by my stupidity," returned Max, with playful
look and tone.</p>

<p>"Hark! there's the tea-bell," said Lucilla.
"I invite you all out to the dining-room."</p>

<p>After a pleasant social half hour spent at
the tea-table, each couple retired to their own
apartments to dress for the evening entertainment
at Woodburn.</p>

<p>"This is one of the occasions for the wearing
of the wedding-gown, is it not?" Max
said inquiringly to Evelyn, as they passed
into her dressing-room.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said lightly. "You will not
mind seeing me in it for the second time,
will you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall be very glad to. It is both beautiful
and becoming," he returned, with a
fond look and smile. "Ah, my Eva, I think
no one ever had a sweeter bride than mine,"
he added, passing his arm about her and
drawing her into a close embrace.</p>

<p>"They say love is blind and it must be that
which makes me look so lovely in your eyes;
for my features are by no means so good and
regular as those of some others&mdash;your sisters
Lu and Grace, for instance," returned Evelyn,
with a pleased little laugh.</p>

<p>"Those sisters of mine are both beautiful
in my eyes, but there is something&mdash;to
me&mdash;still sweeter in this dear face," he
answered to that, giving her a fond caress as
he spoke.</p>

<p>"And your love is so sweet to me, I am so
glad to belong to you," she returned low and
feelingly, laying her head on his breast while
glad tears shone in her eyes. "I have only
one cause for grief left," she went on presently&mdash;"that
we cannot live together all the
time, as Lu and Chester may; yet spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
that I would not change with her or anybody
else."</p>

<p>"I hope not, darling," he said, laughingly.
"Nor would I any more than you. I think
we were made for each other."</p>

<p>"So do I; and when compelled to part for
a season we will console ourselves by looking
forward to the joy of the reunion."</p>

<p>"So we will, dear one; and in the meantime
we will have the pleasure of correspondence."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! a letter from my husband
will be a great treasure and delight to me."</p>

<p>"Not more than will be one from my wife
to me," he returned, giving her a gleeful
caress.</p>

<p>Meantime, Chester and his Lucilla were
similarly engaged. Chester was very proud
and fond of his bride and anxious to show
her to neighbours and friends in her wedding
dress; so expressed his satisfaction when he
saw it laid out in readiness for the occasion.</p>

<p>"I am glad it pleases you," said Lucilla,
"and I own to liking it right well myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Eva is going to wear hers, too. So it will
seem something like a repetition of our wedding
day."</p>

<p>"Which makes it very suitable for your
father's house. It was a disappointment to
him, I know, not to have his daughter and
son married in his own house."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so; but dear father is so
unselfish that he preferred to let us have our
own way, especially on Eva's account."</p>

<p>"I know it, and mean to try to copy his
example in that&mdash;seeking to please others
rather than myself."</p>

<p>"As I do; I should like to resemble him
in character and conduct as much as some
persons tell me I do in features and expression."</p>

<p>"Yes; you are very like him in both,"
Chester said, with an affectionate and admiring
look and smile; "in character and conduct
also, if your admiring husband be any
judge."</p>

<p>The Sunnyside couples were the first of
the guests to reach Woodburn&mdash;though, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
fact, they hardly considered themselves
guests, or were deemed such by the family
there; it was but going home to their father's
house, where they had an hour of keen enjoyment
before other relatives and guests began
to arrive.</p>

<p>Everything went smoothly; the company
was made up of congenial spirits, the entertainment
was fine and evidently enjoyed,
and when they bade good-night and scattered
to their homes it was with the expectation of
meeting again the next evening at Fairview.
The Dinsmores of the Oaks had planned to
give the second entertainment, but Mr. and
Mrs. Leland claimed it as their right, because
of their near relationship to Evelyn,
and the fact that Fairview had been her
home for so many years.</p>

<p>They were now nearing the end of the
week; this was Thursday, the Fairview
party would be held on Friday evening and
Saturday all preferred to spend quietly in
their own homes or with the nearest and dearest.
And that was the plan carried out. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Fairview party passed off as successfully as
had the Woodburn one, and Saturday and
Sunday brought a rest from festivities which
was welcome to all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Lucilla</span> could never stay long away from
her old home in her father's house; she was
there every day and often two or three times
a day.</p>

<p>"Father," she said, on that first Saturday
after taking possession of the new home,
"mayn't we Sunnyside folks come over here
and join your Bible class to-morrow evening?"</p>

<p>"My dear child, it is just what I would
have you do," he returned, with a gratified
and loving smile. "Don't forget that Woodburn
is still your home&mdash;one of your homes
at least&mdash;and that you are always welcome
and more than welcome to join us when you
will. You are my own daughter as truly as
ever you were."</p>

<p>"And just as glad to be as ever I was," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
exclaimed, with a bright, loving look and
smile. "And to do your bidding at all times,
father dear," she added.</p>

<p>"Provided it does not interfere with Chester's,"
Max, who happened to be present,
suggested a little mischievously.</p>

<p>"Hardly any danger of that, I think," remarked
his father, with a slightly amused
look; "Chester is a reasonable fellow, and I
have no intention of interfering with his
rights."</p>

<p>"And he thinks almost as highly of my
father's wisdom as I do," said Lucilla.</p>

<p>"But not more than Max and I do," said
Evelyn, giving the Captain a very filial and
admiring look; "and you will take us in as
members of your class, too, wont you
father?"</p>

<p>"It is just what I desire to do," was the
pleased reply. "Max has always been a member
when at home; and you, you know, are
now his better half."</p>

<p>Eva shook her head and with a merry,
laughing look at Max, said, "Not just that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
father; I should say the smaller partner in
the firm."</p>

<p>"That will do, too," smiled the Captain,
"since the most costly goods are apt to be
done up in the smallest packages."</p>

<p>"Ah, Eva, my dear, you are answered,"
laughed Max.</p>

<p>"What is to be the subject of to-morrow's
lesson, Captain?" asked Mrs. Elsie Travilla,
sitting near.</p>

<p>"I have not decided that question yet,
mother, and should be glad of a suggestion
from you," he replied in a kindly, respectful
tone.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking a good deal lately
of the signs of the times," she said, "and
whether they do not show that we are nearing
the end of this dispensation. That
might perhaps be a profitable and interesting
question to take up and endeavor to
solve."</p>

<p>"No doubt it would be," he replied, "and
I hope you will come prepared to give us
some information as to what the Scriptures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
say on the subject, and what are the views of
Biblical scholars who have been giving it
particular attention."</p>

<p>"I will do what I can in that line, and
hope you, Captain, and others will come prepared
to take part in considering the subject."</p>

<p>"Certainly a most interesting one," said
Violet.</p>

<p>"And one which must lead to great searching
of the Scriptures as the only infallible
source of information," added the Captain.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Grandma Elsie, "they are the
only authority on that subject. And how
thankful we should be that we have them."</p>

<p>Sabbath afternoon proved bright and
clear, and brought to Woodburn quite a
gathering of the relatives and friends; for
all loved the Bible studies they had for years
taken together.</p>

<p>Mr. Lilburn, as the eldest, was persuaded
to take the lead.</p>

<p>"I understand," he said, "that to-day we
are to take up the question whether the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ may,
or may not, be near. The Scriptures are our
sole authority, and you are all invited to
bring forward anything from them which
may seem to you to have a bearing on the
subject." Then turning to Mrs. Travilla,
"Cousin Elsie," he said, "you are, probably,
the one among us the most thoroughly
prepared to do so; please let us hear from
you."</p>

<p>"I doubt if I am better prepared than
some of the rest of you," she replied, "but I
have been very much interested in the subject;
particularly of late, and have searched
the Bible for texts bearing upon it, some of
which I will read. Here in the first chapter
of Acts we read that the disciples asked,
'Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again
the kingdom to Israel? And he said unto
them, It is not for you to know the times or
the seasons, which the Father hath put in his
own power. But ye shall receive power, after
that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye
shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto
the uttermost part of the earth. And when
he had spoken these things, while they beheld,
He was taken up and the clouds received
him out of their sight. And while
they looked steadfastly toward Heaven as he
went up, behold, two men stood by them in
white apparel; which also said, Ye men of
Gallilee, why stand ye gazing up into
Heaven? This same Jesus which is taken
up from you into Heaven, shall so come in
like manner as ye have seen him go into
Heaven.' And," continued Grandma Elsie,
"the Apostle John gives us the same promise
here in the first chapter of the Revelation,"
turning to the passage as she spoke,
then reading it aloud, "'Behold, he cometh
with clouds; and every eye shall see him.'"</p>

<p>"I have heard the idea advanced that
death is the coming of Christ to the dying
one," remarked Chester, in a tone of inquiry.</p>

<p>"But we are told," said Mrs. Travilla,
"that 'as the lightning cometh out of the east,
and shineth even unto the west; so shall also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the coming of the Son of Man be.' That description
certainly could not apply to the
death hour of any Christian, nor to the conversion
of any sinner."</p>

<p>"And his second coming is spoken of in
the same way in a number of places in the
different gospels," said Evelyn. "Here, in
Luke, we have Christ's own words, 'Whosoever
shall be ashamed of Me and of My
words, of him shall the Son of Man be
ashamed, when He shall come in His glory,
and in His Father's, and of the holy angels.'
And again in Matthew 16:27, 'For the Son
of Man shall come in the glory of His Father
with His angels; and then He shall reward
every man according to his works.'"</p>

<p>"The disciples wanted to know when that
second coming would be," remarked Violet;
"here in Matthew 24:3, we are told, 'And as
He sat upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples
came unto Him privately, saying, "Tell
us when shall these things be and what shall
be the sign of Thy coming and of the end of
the world?" And Jesus answered and said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
unto them, "Take heed that no man deceive
you."'</p>

<p>"I shall not read the whole chapter, for I
know it is familiar to you all; but in the
27th verse he says, 'For as the lightning
cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto
the west; so shall also the coming of the Son
of Man be. For wheresoever the carcass is,
there will the eagles be gathered together.
Immediately after the tribulation of those
days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon
shall not give her light, and the stars shall
fall from Heaven, and the powers of the
Heavens shall be shaken: And then shall appear
the sign of the Son of Man in Heaven:
And then shall all the tribes of the earth
mourn, and they shall see the Son of Man
coming in the clouds of Heaven with power
and great glory. And He shall send His
angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and
they shall gather his elect from the four
winds, from one end of Heaven to the
other.'"</p>

<p>"Many persons," remarked Grandma Elsie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
"tell us it is not worth while to consider
at all the question of the time when Christ
will come again; quoting the text, 'But of
that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not
the angels in Heaven, but my Father only.'
But again and again our Saviour repeated
his warning, 'Watch, therefore; for ye know
not what hour your Lord doth come....
Therefore be ye also ready; for in such an
hour as ye think not the Son of Man
cometh.'"</p>

<p>"I do not quite understand this," said
Grace. "Luke says, here in the 21st chapter,
20th verse&mdash;quoting the words of the Master&mdash;'And
when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed
with armies, then know that the desolation
thereof is nigh. Then let them which
are in Judea flee to the mountains; and let
them which are in the midst of it depart out.'
How could they depart out of the city while
it was compassed with armies?"</p>

<p>"There is a satisfactory explanation," replied
her father, "in the twelfth year of
Nero, Cestius Gallus, the president of Syria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
came against Jerusalem with a powerful
army. Josephus says of him: 'He might
have assaulted and taken the city, and thereby
put an end to the war; but without any
just reason, and contrary to the expectation
of all, he raised the siege and departed.' The
historians, Epiphanius and Eusebius, tell us
that immediately after the departure of the
armies of Cestius Gallus, and while Vespasian
was approaching with his army, all
who believed in Christ left Jerusalem and
fled to Pella and other places beyond the
river Jordan."</p>

<p>"Every one of them, papa?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes; Dr. Adam Clarke says 'It is very
remarkable that not a single Christian perished
in the destruction of Jerusalem,
though there were many there when Cestius
Gallus invested the city.'"</p>

<p>"Papa," asked Elsie, "don't you think
God put it in the heart of that Cestius Gallus
to go away with his troops before Vespasian
got there; so that the Christians had
an opportunity to escape?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"I certainly do, daughter," was the Captain's
emphatic reply.</p>

<p>"Had not the earlier prophets foretold the
destruction of Jerusalem?" asked Lucilla.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Lilburn; "even as early a
one as Moses. Here in the 28th chapter of
Deuteronomy he says 'The Lord shall bring
a nation against thee from far, from the
east of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth;
a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand.'"</p>

<p>"The Romans?" Elsie said, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes; their ensign was an eagle and their
language the Latin, which the Jews did not
understand. The prophesy of Moses continues.
In the 52d verse he says, 'And he
shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy
high and fenced walls come down; wherein
thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and
he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout
thy land, which the Lord thy God hath
given thee. And thou shalt eat the fruit of
thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of
thy daughters, which the Lord thy God hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
given thee, in the siege and in the straitness,
wherewith thine enemies shall distress
thee.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, how dreadful!" exclaimed Elsie.
"And did all that happen at the siege of
Jerusalem?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it lasted so long that famine was
added to all the other sufferings of the besieged.
So dreadful was it that mothers
would snatch the food from their children in
their distress, and many houses were found
full of women and children who had died
of starvation. Josephus tells of human
flesh being eaten; particularly of a lady
of rank who killed, roasted and ate her own
son. And so the prophecy of Moses was fulfilled."</p>

<p>"Oh, how dreadful, how dreadful!" sighed
Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Lilburn, "it was the fulfillment
of our Saviour's prophecy as he beheld
Jerusalem and wept over it, saying, 'If
thou hadst known, even thou at least in this
thy day, the things which belong unto thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.
For the days shall come upon thee, that thine
enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and
compass thee round, and keep thee in on
every side, and shall lay thee even with the
ground, and thy children within thee; and
they shall not leave in thee one stone upon
another; because thou knewest not the time
of thy visitation.' That is told us in the 19th
chapter of Luke. In the 21st we read, 'And
they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and
shall be led away captive into all nations:
and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the
Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be
fulfilled.'"</p>

<p>"Have those times been fulfilled yet?"
asked Ned.</p>

<p>"No, not yet," replied Mr. Lilburn; "the
Turks still have possession of Jerusalem,
though the Jews have begun to return to Palestine
and the Turkish power grows weaker.
But the time of the Gentiles will not be fulfilled
until the work of the Gospel is finished."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"And when will that be, Cousin Ronald?"
asked Ned.</p>

<p>"I cannot say exactly," answered the old
gentleman, "but the trend of events does
seem to show that we are nearing that time&mdash;such
a feeling of unrest all over the world,
some men&mdash;comparatively a few&mdash;accumulating
enormous quantities of wealth by paying
their laborers a mere pittance for their
work, while the cost of living goes higher and
higher. This is a land of plenty, and but for
the grasping selfishness of some, none need
lack for abundance of the necessaries of
life."</p>

<p>"I wish nobody did lack for plenty to eat
and drink, and wear," said Elsie, "and I
want to do all I can to help those who haven't
enough."</p>

<p>"I hope you will, daughter," the Captain
said, in a tone of pleased approval. "And
now the important thing for us to consider
is what is our duty, in view of the very possible
nearness of Christ's second coming."</p>

<p>"He has told us again and again to watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and be ready," said Grandma Elsie; "yet we
are not to be idle, but to work while it is
called to-day; to occupy till he comes; to be
not slothful in business, fervent in spirit,
serving the Lord."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the next week or two, family parties
for the honor and entertainment of the
newly-married ones were frequent. Life
seemed to them bright and joyous, except
when they remembered that Max would
probably soon be ordered away, perhaps to
some distant quarter of the globe. An unwelcome
anticipation not to them only, but to
his father and the others at Woodburn, and
in a slighter degree to all the connection. But
orders had not come yet, and they still hoped
they might be delayed for weeks, giving opportunity
for many quiet home pleasures.
Yet there were drawbacks to even those, in
the fact that several of the near connection
were ailing from colds caught during their
round of festivities&mdash;Grandma Elsie and
Chester Dinsmore being of those most seriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
affected. Chester was confined to the
house for several days, under the doctor's
care, and it was against medical advice that
he then returned to his labors at his office.
Lucilla was troubled and anxious, and, as
usual, went to her father for sympathy and
advice. They had a chat together in the library
at Woodburn.</p>

<p>"I feel for you, daughter," Captain Raymond
said, "but keep up your courage; 'all is
not lost that is in danger.' I have been thinking
that a southerly trip in the yacht might
prove of benefit to both Grandma Elsie and
Chester, and quite agreeable to the members
of my family and other friends for whom we
could find room."</p>

<p>"Oh, father, that would be delightful!"
she exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with pleasure.
"And I hope you will persuade Harold
to make one of the company, for Grace's
sake, and so that we will not be without a
physician."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is a part of my plan, and I have
little doubt of its acceptance, Grace's companionship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
being a great attraction to my
young brother-in-law."</p>

<p>"'Speak of angels and you will hear the
flutter of their wings,'" laughed Lucilla, as
at that moment Harold appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Am I the angel, and may I fly in?" he
asked, joining in the laugh.</p>

<p>"Certainly, you are just in the nick of
time to advise us in a matter of importance
which we were discussing," replied the Captain,
inviting him by a gesture to an easy
chair near at hand, then repeating to him the
substance of what he had been saying to Lucilla,
finishing with a request for his opinion
in regard to the plan.</p>

<p>"I like it extremely," Harold said. "I
think nothing could be better for either
mother or Chester, and the sooner we make
ready and start the better for both, if they
will be persuaded to go; of which I have
little doubt."</p>

<p>"I am somewhat afraid Chester may refuse
for business reasons," sighed Lucilla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think we can persuade him of the folly
of that," said her father. "It would be far
wiser and better to give up business for a
time for the gaining of health, than to so
wreck that by overtaxing strength of body
and mind as to shorten his days or make
himself an invalid for life."</p>

<p>"It certainly would," said Harold, "and I
hope that among us we can convince him that
duty, as well as pleasure, calls him to make
one of our party."</p>

<p>"Duty to his wife as well as to himself,"
said Lucilla, in a lively tone; "for I should
neither willingly go without him or stay behind
with him."</p>

<p>"Where are Vi, Grace and the children?"
asked Harold. "I have not seen or heard
anything of them since I came in."</p>

<p>"Max and Eva have taken them driving
in our fine new carriage&mdash;father's wedding
gift," replied Lucilla, with a smiling glance
into her father's eyes. "That is, all but Ned
who rides his pony alongside."</p>

<p>"Ah, and here they come now!" exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Harold, glancing from the window, "the carriage
has just turned in at the gates."</p>

<p>And with that the three arose and hastened
out to the veranda, to greet and assist
them to alight. But the moment the carriage
drew up before the entrance the door was
thrown open and Max, then Chester, sprang
out and turned to hand out the ladies&mdash;Grandma
Elsie, Eva, Violet, Grace and her
sister Elsie, while at the same time Ned was
dismounting from his pony.</p>

<p>Warm greetings were exchanged, and as
the weather was now too cool for comfortable
sitting upon the veranda the Captain led the
way to the library&mdash;a favorite resort with
them all.</p>

<p>"Your call is an agreeable surprise,
mother," he said to Grandma Elsie, as he
drew forward an easy chair for her; "Harold
had just been telling us that you were almost
ill with a cold."</p>

<p>"I have a rather bad one, but thought a
drive through the bracing air, and in such
pleasant company, might prove beneficial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
rather than otherwise," she answered in
cheery tones, adding "And I knew Harold
was here and could take me home in his conveyance."</p>

<p>"Certainly, mother, and will be very glad
of your good company," said Harold, while
at the same time Violet exclaimed, "But why
go at all to-night, mother? Why not stay
here with us?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, daughter," was the smiling
reply; "that would be pleasant, but
there are some things to be attended to at
home."</p>

<p>"And not being well, she would better
have her doctor close at hand," remarked
Harold, in playful tone. "Mother, we have
been contriving a plan to help you and Chester
to get the better of your colds."</p>

<p>"Ah, what is that?" she asked, and Harold,
turning to the Captain, said, "Let
mother hear it from you, Brother Levis, if
you please."</p>

<p>"We are thinking of taking a southward
trip in the 'Dolphin,' mother&mdash;visiting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Bermudas, Bahamas and other of the West
Indies and the coast of Brazil."</p>

<p>"Why, that would be a lovely trip!" she
exclaimed. "Many thanks to you, Captain,
for including me among your invited
guests."</p>

<p>"Many thanks to you, mother, if you consent
to make one of our party," he returned,
looking greatly pleased to find her so ready
to approve of and share their plans.</p>

<p>Eager, excited remarks and queries now
followed in rapid succession from the others
present&mdash;"When was the start to be made?
Who besides Grandma Elsie and the Captain
were to compose the party?"</p>

<p>"All who are here now are invited and expected
to go; some others of our friends
also," replied the Captain, "and I hope no
one will refuse."</p>

<p>"Thanks, warm thanks," said Chester. "I
should be delighted to go, but fear business
will prevent."</p>

<p>"As your physician, Ches, I strongly advise
you not to let it," said Harold. "A good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
rest now in a warm climate may restore you
to vigorous health, while if you stay at home
and stick to business you are likely to either
cut your life short or make yourself a confirmed
invalid for the rest of it."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so, cousin doctor?"
was Chester's rejoinder in a troubled voice.</p>

<p>"I do most emphatically," returned Harold.
"You may be very thankful, cousin,
that this good opportunity offers."</p>

<p>"I am," said Chester. Then turning to
the Captain. "Thank you very much, sir,
for the invitation, which I accept, if my wife
will go with me."</p>

<p>"You needn't doubt that," laughed Lucilla.
"There is nothing I like better than a
trip on my father's yacht, with him and all
my dear ones about me."</p>

<p>"And it's just the same with all the rest
of us," said Grace.</p>

<p>"And how is it with Max and Eva?" asked
the Captain.</p>

<p>"I know of nothing more enjoyable than
that&mdash;a trip on the 'Dolphin' taken in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
company of one's dear ones," replied Evelyn
with a loving look into the eyes of her young
husband.</p>

<p>"Just my opinion," he said, with a smile;
"the only question with me is, Will Uncle
Sam allow me a sufficiently long leave of absence."</p>

<p>"Your leave of absence has nearly expired?"
his father said, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; so nearly that I should hardly
feel surprised to receive orders any day."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope, instead, you may get another
leave, allowing you time to make one
of our party."</p>

<p>"It would be a very great pleasure to me,
sir," said Max. "But I have had so long a
one already that I can hardly hope for another
very soon."</p>

<p>"Oh, Max!" exclaimed Grace, "do write
at once asking to have it extended; it would
double our pleasure to have you along."</p>

<p>"Yes, Max, do," said Lucilla. "I can
hardly bear the thought of going without
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Evelyn, sitting close at his side, looked her
entreaties, while Violet said, "Yes, Max, do;
it will double our enjoyment to have you and
Eva along."</p>

<p>Then Chester, Grandma Elsie, Harold
and the children added their entreaties, expressing
their desire for his company on the
trip and Ned exclaimed, "Yes, Brother Max,
do get leave to go along; we'll want you to
make fun for us with your ventriloquism."</p>

<p>"Is that all you want me for, Neddie
boy?" laughed Max. "If so, Cousin Ronald
will answer your purpose quite as well, if
not better."</p>

<p>"But two can make more fun than one;
and I want you besides, because I am really
fond of you&mdash;the only brother I've got."</p>

<p>"Ah, that sounds better," said Max; "but
I really can't go without Uncle Sam's permission."</p>

<p>"Then please do ask him to give it."</p>

<p>"Yes, do, Max," said Grace; "I really
think he might give it, considering what
good service you did at Manila."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was not very much that I accomplished
personally," returned Max modestly,
"and the two months' rest I have had is probably
quite as much as I may be supposed
to have earned. Especially as it gave
me the opportunity to secure my wife,"
he added, with a very affectionate look at
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"I wish you might be able to go with us,
Max, my son," said the Captain, "for leaving
ventriloquism entirely out of the account, I
should be very glad to have your company.
But the service, of course, has the first claim
on you."</p>

<p>"So I think, sir; and as for the ventriloquism,
my little brother is so hungry for,
Cousin Ronald can supply it should you take
him as one of your passengers."</p>

<p>"And that we will, if he and his wife can
be persuaded to go," returned the Captain,
heartily.</p>

<p>"Oh, good, papa!" cried Ned, clapping his
hands in glee, "then we'll have at least one
ventriloquist, if we can't have two."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"And, after all, the ventriloquism was
really all you wanted me for, eh?" said Max,
assuming a tone and look of chagrin.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! no! Brother Max," cried Ned,
with a look of distress. "I didn't mean that!
you know you're the only brother I have and
I'm really fond of you."</p>

<p>"As I am of you, little brother, and have
been ever since you were born," said Max,
regarding the little fellow with an affectionate
smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, Max, I wish you hadn't gone into the
navy," sighed Lucilla.</p>

<p>"I don't," he returned, cheerfully, "though
I acknowledge that it is hard parting with
home and dear ones."</p>

<p>"That is bad, as I know by experience,"
said their father, "but then we have the compensating
joy of the many reunions."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and a great joy it is," responded
Max. "How soon, father, do you think of
starting on your southward trip?"</p>

<p>"Just as soon as all necessary arrangements
can be made, which, I suppose, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
not be more than a week from this, at farthest.
I can have the yacht made ready in
less time than that, and for the sake of our
invalids it would be well to go as promptly
as possible."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you make use of the telephone
now, to give your invitations, my dear?"
queried Violet.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; that is a wise suggestion. I
will do so at once," he replied, and hastily
left the room, promising to return presently
with the reply from Beechwood to which he
would call first.</p>

<p>The invitation was accepted promptly and
with evident pleasure, as the Captain presently
reported in the library.</p>

<p>"Now, mother, shall I give my invitation
in the same way to our own friends?" he
asked, turning to Grandma Elsie.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be as well to send it by
Harold and me," she said, "as that will delay
it very little, and I can perhaps help them to
perceive what a delightful trip it is likely to
prove."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"And then, mamma, you can give us their
view by the 'phone," said Violet.</p>

<p>"I, or some one of the family will," she
said. "And now, Harold, we will go and attend
to the matter at once."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Captain Raymond's</span> invitation proved
scarcely less agreeable to Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore
than to their younger friends and relatives,
and their acceptance was telephoned to
Woodburn before the Sunnyside party had
left for their homes. All heard it with satisfaction,
for Grandpa and Grandma Dinsmore
were pleasant traveling companions.
Some lively chat followed, in regard to
needed preparations for the trip, and in the
midst of it a servant came in with the afternoon
mail.</p>

<p>The Captain distributed it and among
Max's portion was a document of official appearance.
Evelyn noted it with a look of apprehension,
and drew nearer to her young
husband's side.</p>

<p>"Orders, my son?" asked the Captain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
when Max had opened it and glanced over
the contents.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I am to go immediately to
Washington, upon the expiration of my leave
which will be about the time the rest of you
set sail in the 'Dolphin.'"</p>

<p>The announcement seemed quite a damper
upon the previous high spirits of the little
company, and there were many expressions
of disappointment and regret.</p>

<p>"Well," said Chester, getting on his feet
as he spoke, "I must go home now; there
is a little matter in regard to one of my
cases that must be attended to at once, since
I am likely to leave the neighborhood so
soon."</p>

<p>"And if my husband goes, I must go, too,"
said Lucilla, in a lively tone, rising and taking
up the wrap she had thrown off on coming
into the warm room.</p>

<p>"It is near the dinner hour; you would
better stay, all of you, and dine with us,"
said the Captain.</p>

<p>All thanked him, but declined, each having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
some special reason for wishing to go
home at that particular time.</p>

<p>"Well, come in and share a meal with us
whenever you will," said the Captain. "I
think you know, one and all, that you are
heartily welcome."</p>

<p>"Yes, father, we do," said Max, "and we
are always glad when you care to breakfast,
dine, or sup with us."</p>

<p>"Any of us but papa?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; all of you from Mamma Vi
down," laughed Max, giving the little fellow
an affectionate clap on the shoulder as he
passed him on his way out to the hall.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ned, each one of you will always be
a most welcome visitor," said Chester.</p>

<p>"Indeed you will, you may be very sure
of that," added Lucilla and Eva.</p>

<p>"So sure are we of that, that you need not
be surprised to see any of us at any time,"
laughed Violet. "Nor will we be surprised or
grieved to see any or all of you at any time."</p>

<p>"No, indeed! I want my daughters&mdash;and
sons also&mdash;all to feel entirely at home always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
in their father's house," the Captain said,
with his genial smile.</p>

<p>"Thank you, father dear, and don't forget
that Sunnyside is one of your homes, and
we are always ever so glad to open its doors
to you," said Lucilla, going to him and holding
up her face for a kiss, which he gave with
warmth of affection.</p>

<p>"And not Lu's side only, but ours as well,"
added Evelyn, holding out her hand and
looking up lovingly into his face.</p>

<p>He took the hand, drew her closer to him
and gave her a caress as affectionate as that
he had just bestowed upon Lucilla.</p>

<p>The rest of the good-byes were quickly
said, and both young couples were wending
their homeward way. They were all in
thoughtful mood, and the short walk was
taken in almost unbroken silence.</p>

<p>Eva's heart was full at thought of the approaching
separation from her young husband.
How could she bear it? He seemed
almost all the world to her, now that they
had been for weeks such close companions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and life without his presence would be lonely
and desolate indeed. She passed up the stairway
to their bedroom, while he paused in the
hall below to remove his overcoat and hat.
Her eyes were full of tears, as she disposed
of her wraps, then crossed the room to her
mirror to see that dress and hair were in
perfect order.</p>

<p>"No improvement needed, my own love,
my darling," Max said, coming up behind
her and passing an arm about her waist.</p>

<p>At that she turned and hid her face upon
his breast.</p>

<p>"Oh, Max, my husband, my dear, dear
husband," she sobbed, "how can I live away
from you? You are now more than all the
world to me."</p>

<p>"As you are to me, dear love. It is hard
to part, but we will hope to meet again soon;
and in the meantime let us write to each
other every day. And as there is no war now
you need not feel that your husband is in any
special danger."</p>

<p>"Yes, thank God for that," she said, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that we may know that we are both in his
kind care and keeping wherever we are."</p>

<p>"And surely you will be less lonely than
you were before our marriage&mdash;father
claims you as his daughter, Chester and little
Ned are your brothers, Lu and Grace your
sisters."</p>

<p>"Yes, oh yes; I have a great deal to be
thankful for, but you are to me a greater
blessing than all the world."</p>

<p>"As you are to me, dearest," was his response,
as he held her close to his heart,
pressing warm kisses on cheek and brow and
lip.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the hall,
Chester and Lucilla were chatting about the
Captain's plan for a winter trip.</p>

<p>"I think it will be just delightful, Chester,"
she said, "since I am to have you along.
I am so glad you are going, sorry as I am
that ill-health makes it necessary."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear," he returned with a smile,
"I am fortunate, indeed, in having so loving
a wife and so kind and able a father-in-law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
I am truly sorry that I must leave some important
business matters to which I should
like to give attention promptly and in person,
but I intend to put that care aside and
enjoy our holiday as fully as possible. I
heartily wish Max could go with us. I think
it would almost double the pleasure of the
trip."</p>

<p>"As I do," responded Lucilla, with a sigh;
"but it seems one can never have all one
wants in this world. I doubt if it would be
good for us if we could."</p>

<p>"No, it assuredly would not. Now, my
dear, I am going down to the library to look
at some papers connected with one of my
cases, and shall probably be busy over them
until the call to dinner."</p>

<p>The next few days were busy ones with
those who were to have a part in the southern
trip of the "Dolphin." Woodburn and Sunnyside
were to be left in the care of Christine
and Alma, with a sufficient number of servants
under them to keep everything in order.</p>

<p>Max went with the others to the yacht,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
spent a half hour there, then bade good-bye,
went ashore and took a train for Washington.
It was Eva's first parting from her
husband, and she shut herself into her stateroom
for a cry to relieve her pent-up feelings
of grief and loneliness. But presently there
was a gentle little tap at the door and Elsie
Raymond's sweet voice asked, "Sister Eva,
dear, don't you want to come on deck with
me and see them lift the anchor and start the
'Dolphin' on her way?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear little sister; thank you for coming
for me," replied Evelyn, opening the
door.</p>

<p>"All the rest of us were there and I
thought you would like to be there, too," continued
the little girl, as they passed through
the saloon and on up the stairway.</p>

<p>"Yes, little sister, it was very kind in you
to think of me."</p>

<p>"But I wasn't the only one; everybody
seemed to be thinking of you and looking
round for you. So I asked papa if I should
come for you, and he said yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was very kind in both him and you,
little sister Elsie," Eva said, with a smile.
"Our dear father is always kind, and I am
very glad to be his daughter."</p>

<p>"So am I," returned Elsie, with a happy
little laugh. "I think he's the dearest, kindest
father that ever was made."</p>

<p>They had just reached the deck at that
moment, and as they stepped upon it they
caught sight of Harold and Grace standing
near, looking smilingly at them, pleased with
Elsie's tribute to her father, which they had
accidentally overheard.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Harold, you'll take Sister Eva
to a good place to see everything from, wont
you?" exclaimed Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes, little niece, the everything you
mean," he returned, laughingly. "There is
room for us all. Come this way," he added,
and led them to that part of the deck where
the other passengers were grouped.</p>

<p>There they were greeted with kindness and
given a good place for seeing all the preparations
for starting the vessel on her way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the Bermudas. She was soon moving swiftly
in that direction, and, a cool breeze having
sprung up, her passengers left the deck for
the warmer and more comfortable saloon.</p>

<p>"Elsie and Ned wouldn't you like your
grandma to tell you something about the
islands we are going to?" asked Mrs. Travilla;
the two little ones being, as usual,
quite near her.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! grandma," both answered,
in eager tones, seating themselves one on
each side of her. "I heard papa say it
wouldn't be a very long voyage we would
take at the start, because the Bermudas were
only about six hundred miles away from our
coast," said Elsie. "They belong to England,
don't they, grandma?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but they were named for a Spaniard,
Bermudez, who first sighted them in
1527; they are also called Somers's Isles
from Sir George Somers, an Englishman,
who was shipwrecked there in 1609. That
was what led to their colonization from Virginia&mdash;two
years later when it was itself
only four years old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are they big islands, grandma? and are
there many of them?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"No, there are perhaps five hundred of
them, but the whole group measures only
about twelve thousand acres in all. They
occupy a space only about twenty miles long
by six broad."</p>

<p>"Then the group isn't worth very much, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, because its situation makes it a
natural fortress which can hardly be overrated.
They form a bond of union between
two great divisions of British America; on
each side of them is a highway between the
Gulf of Mexico and the North Atlantic.
There are many picturesque creeks and bays,
large and deep, the water so clear as to reveal,
even to its lowest depths, the many varieties
of fish sporting among the coral rocks,
and the beautifully variegated shells."</p>

<p>"And it has a warm climate, hasn't it,
grandma?" asked Elsie. "I think that is why
we are going there."</p>

<p>"Yes, the climate is said to be like that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Persia, with the addition of a constant sea-breeze."</p>

<p>"I shall like that," responded the little girl
with satisfaction. "But what kind of people
live there, grandma?"</p>

<p>"A good many whites and still more colored
people."</p>

<p>"Slaves, grandma?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"No; the islands belong to England, and
years ago she abolished slavery in all her dominions."</p>

<p>"What are the names of some of them,
grandma? the islands, I mean."</p>

<p>"The largest, which is fifteen miles long,
is called Bermuda; St. George is three and a
half miles long and is the military station of
the colony; it commands the entrance of the
only passage for large vessels. Its land-locked
haven and the narrow and intricate
channel leading into it are defended by
strong batteries."</p>

<p>"You have been there, haven't you,
grandma?"</p>

<p>"Yes; years ago," she said, with a sigh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
thinking of the loved partner of her life who
had been with her then and there.</p>

<p>"And your Grandpa Dinsmore and I were
there at the same time," remarked Grandma
Dinsmore, sitting near; and she went on to
give a graphic account of scenes they had
witnessed there, Mr. Dinsmore presently
joining in a way to make it very interesting
to the children.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Grandpa Dinsmore</span> had hardly finished
relating his reminiscences of his former visits
to the Bermudas when a sailor-lad came
down the companionway with a message
from the Captain&mdash;an invitation to any or
all his passengers to come up on deck, as
there was something he wished to show them.
It was promptly and eagerly accepted by the
young folks,&mdash;somewhat more slowly and
sedately by the older ones.</p>

<p>"What is it, papa? Have you something
to show us?" queried Ned, as he gained his
father's side.</p>

<p>"Something lying yonder in the sea, my
son, the like of which you have never seen
before," replied the Captain, pointing to a
large object in the water at some little distance.</p>

<p>"Ah, a whale!" exclaimed Dr. Travilla,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
who had come up on Ned's other side. "To
what genus does he belong, Captain?"</p>

<p>"He is a bottlenose; a migratory species,
confined to the North Atlantic. It ranges
far northward in the summer, southward in
the winter. In the early spring they may be
found around Iceland and Greenland, Western
Spitzbergen, in Davis Strait and probably
about Novaia Zemlia."</p>

<p>"Oh, do they like to live right in among
the icebergs, papa?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"No, they do not venture in among the ice
itself, but frequent open bays along its margin,
as in that way they are sheltered from
the open sea."</p>

<p>"The group gathered about the Captain on
the deck now comprised all his cabin passengers,
not one of whom failed to be interested
in the whale, or to have some remark to make
or question to ask.</p>

<p>"This one seems to be alone," remarked
Lucilla. "Do they usually go alone, papa?"</p>

<p>"No; they are generally found in herds of
from four to ten; and many different herds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
may be found in sight at the same time. The
old males, however, are frequently solitary;
though sometimes one of them may be seen
leading a herd. These whales don't seem to
be afraid of ships, swimming around them
and underneath the boats till their curiosity
is satisfied."</p>

<p>"I suppose they take them&mdash;the ships&mdash;for
a kind of big fish," laughed Ned.</p>

<p>"Why is this kind of whale called bottlenosed,
papa?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"That name is given it because of the elevation
of the upper surface of the head above
the rather short beak and in front of the
blow hole into a rounded abrupt prominence."</p>

<p>"Blow hole," repeated Ned, wonderingly;
"what's that, papa?"</p>

<p>"The blow holes are their nostrils through
which they blow out the water collected in
them while they are down below the waves.
They cannot breath under the water, but
must come up frequently to take in a fresh
supply of air. But first they must expel the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
air remaining in their lungs, before taking
in a fresh supply. They send that air out
with great force, so that it rises to a considerable
height above the water, and as it is
saturated with water-vapor at a high temperature,
the contact with the cold outside air
condenses the vapor which forms a column
of steam or spray. Often, however, a whale
begins to blow before its nostrils are quite
above the surface, and then some sea-water
is forced up with the column of air."</p>

<p>They were watching the whale while they
talked; for it followed the yacht with seeming
curiosity. At this moment it rolled over
nearly on its side, then threw its ponderous
tail high into the air, so that for an instant
it was perpendicular to the water, then vanished
from sight beneath the waves.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," cried Ned, "he's gone! I wish
he'd stayed longer."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he will come back and give us
the pleasure of seeing him spout," said the
Captain.</p>

<p>"Do you mean throw the water up out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
its nostrils, papa?" asked Ned. "Oh, I'd
like that!"</p>

<p>"Ah, there's the call to supper," said
his father, as the summons came at that
moment. "You wouldn't like to miss
that?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," returned Ned, in a dubious
tone. "But couldn't we let the supper wait
till the whale comes up and gets done spouting?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps some of the older people may be
too hungry to wait comfortably," returned
his father; "and the supper might be spoiled
by waiting. But cheer up, my son; the whale
is not likely to come up to the surface again
before we can finish our meal and come back
to witness his performance."</p>

<p>That assurance was quite a relief to Ned's
mind, so that he went very cheerfully to the
table with the others, and there did full justice
to the viands.</p>

<p>No one hurried with the meal, but when
they left the table it was to go upon deck
again and watch for the reappearance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
whale. They had been there for but a moment
when, to the delight of all, it came up,
not too far away to be distinctly seen, and at
once began spouting&mdash;or blowing; discharging
the air from its lungs in preparation for
taking in a fresh supply; the air was sent
out with great force, making a sound that
could be heard at quite a distance, while the
water-vapor accompanying the air was so
condensed as to form a column of spray. It
made five or six respirations, then swam
away and was soon lost to sight.</p>

<p>Then the company returned to the cabin
as the more comfortable place, the evening
air being decidedly cool. Ned seated himself
close to his father, and, in coaxing tones,
asked for something more about whales.</p>

<p>"Are there many kinds, papa?" he
queried.</p>

<p>"Yes, my son, a good many; more than
you could remember. Would you like me to
tell you about some of the more interesting
ones?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed, papa!" was the emphatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and pleased response, and the Captain
began at once.</p>

<p>"There are the whalebone or true whales,
which constitute a single family. They have
no teeth, but, instead, horny plates of baleen
or whalebone, which strain from the water
the small animals upon which the whale
feeds."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know about whalebones," said
Ned. "Mamma and sisters have it in their
dresses. And it comes out of the whale's
mouth, does it, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it is composed of many flattened,
horny plates placed crosswise on either side
of the palate, and separated from one another
by an open space in the middle line.
They are smooth on the outer side, but the
inner edge of each plate is frayed out into a
kind of fringe, giving a hairy appearance to
the whole of the inside of the mouth when
viewed from below."</p>

<p>"Whalebone or baleen is black, isn't it,
papa?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Not always; the color may vary from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
black to creamy white; and sometimes it is
striped dark and light."</p>

<p>"Is there much of it in one whale, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a great deal on each side of the jaw;
there are more than three hundred of the
plates, which, in a fine specimen, are about
ten or twelve feet long and eleven inches
wide at their base; and so much as a ton's
weight has been taken from a large whale."</p>

<p>"And is the baleen all they kill the whales
for, papa?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, my son! the oil is very valuable,
and there is a great deal of it in a large
whale. One has been told of which yielded
eighty-five barrels of oil."</p>

<p>"Oh, my! that's a great deal," cried Ned.
"What a big fellow he must have been to hold
so much as that."</p>

<p>"The whale is very valuable to the people
of the polar regions," continued the Captain.
"They eat the flesh, and drink the oil."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa! drink oil!" cried little Elsie,
with a shudder of disgust.</p>

<p>"It seems very disgusting to us," he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
with a smile, "but in that very cold climate
it is an absolute necessity&mdash;needful, in order
to keep up the heat of the body by a bountiful
supply of carbon."</p>

<p>"Whales are so big and strong it must be
very dangerous to go near them, I suppose,"
said Elsie, with an inquiring look at her
father.</p>

<p>"That is the case with some of the species,"
he said, "but not with all. The Greenland
whale, for instance, is inoffensive and
timorous, and will always flee from the presence
of man, unless roused by the pain of a
wound or the sight of its offspring in danger.
In that case, it will sometimes turn fiercely
upon the boat in which the harpooners are
who launched the weapon, and, with its enormous
tail, strike it a blow that will shatter it
and drive men, ropes and oars high into the
air. That Greenland whale shows great affection
for both its mate and its young.
When this whale is undisturbed, it usually
remains at the surface of the water for ten
minutes and spouts eight or nine times; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
it goes down for from five to twenty minutes,
then comes back to the surface to breathe
again. But when harpooned, it dives to a
great depth and does not come up again for
half an hour. By noticing the direction of
the line attached to the harpoon, the whalers
judge of the spot in which it will rise and
generally contrive to be so near it when it
shows itself again, that they can insert another
harpoon, or strike it with a lance before
it can go down again."</p>

<p>"Poor thing!" sighed little Elsie, "I don't
know how men can have the heart to be so
cruel to animals that are not dangerous."</p>

<p>"It is because the oil, whalebone and so
forth, are so valuable," said her father. "It
sometimes happens that a stray whale blunders
into the shallow waters of the Bermudas,
and not being able to find the passage
through which it entered, cannot get out
again; so is caught like a mouse in a trap. It
is soon discovered by the people, and there is
a great excitement; full of delight, they
quickly launch their boats filled with men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
armed with guns, lances and other weapons
which would be of little use in the open sea,
but answer their purpose in these shoal
waters.</p>

<p>"As soon as the whale feels the sharp lance
in its body it dives as it would in the open
sea; but the water is so shallow that it strikes
its head against the rocky bed of the sea with
such force that it rises to the surface again
half stunned.</p>

<p>"The hunters then take advantage of its
bewildered condition to come close and use
their deadly weapons till they have killed it.
The fat and ivory are divided among the
hunters who took part in the killing, but the
flesh is given to any one who asks for it."</p>

<p>"Is it really good to eat, papa?" asked
Ned.</p>

<p>"Those who are judges of whale flesh say
there are three qualities of meat in every
whale, the best resembling mutton, the second
similar to pork, and the third resembling
beef."</p>

<p>"The whales are so big and strong; don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
they ever fight back when men try to kill
them, papa?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "sometimes a large
whale will become belligerent, and is then a
fearful antagonist, using its immense tail
and huge jaws with fearful effect. I have
heard of one driving its lower jaw entirely
through the plankings of a stout whaling
boat, and of another that destroyed nine
boats in succession. Not only boats, but even
ships have been sunk by the attack of an infuriated
old bull cachalot. And an American
ship, the 'Essex' was destroyed by the
vengeful fury of a cachalot, which accidentally
struck itself against the keel. Probably
it thought the ship was a rival whale; it retired
to a short distance, then charged full at
the vessel, striking it one side of the bows,
and crushing beams and planks like straws.
There were only a few men on board at the
time, most of the crew being in the boats engaged
in chasing whales; and when they returned
to their ship they found her fast sinking,
so that they had barely time to secure a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
scanty stock of provisions and water. Using
these provisions as economically as they
could, they made for the coast of Peru, but
only three lived to reach there, and they were
found lying senseless in their boat, which
was drifting at large in the ocean."</p>

<p>"I wonder any one is willing to go whaling
when they may meet with such dreadful accidents,"
said Evelyn.</p>

<p>"I suppose it must be very profitable to
tempt them to take such risks," remarked
Chester.</p>

<p>"It is quite profitable," said the Captain;
"a single whale often yields whalebone and
blubber to the value of thirty-five hundred or
four thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"I should think that might pay very well,
particularly if they took a number."</p>

<p>"Our whale fishing is done mostly by the
New Englanders, isn't it, papa?" asked
Grace.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "they went into it largely at
a very early date; at first on their own coasts,
but they were deserted by the whales before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the middle of the eighteenth century; then
ships were fitted out for the northern seas.
But for a number of years the American
whale-fishery has been declining, because of
the scarcity of whales and the substitutes for
whale oil and whalebone that have been
found. However, New Bedford, Massachusetts,
is the greatest whaling port in the
world.</p>

<p>"Now it is nearing your bedtime, my boy,
and I think you have had enough about the
whale and his habits for one lesson."</p>

<p>"Yes, papa; and I thank you very much
for telling it all to me," replied Ned, with a
loving, grateful look up into his father's
face.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> two hours later the Captain was taking
his usual evening walk upon the deck,
when Lucilla and Evelyn joined him.</p>

<p>"We feel like taking a little stroll, father,
and hope you will not object to our company,"
remarked Evelyn, as they reached his
side.</p>

<p>"I could not, with truth, say it was unpleasant
to me, daughter," he returned, with
a smile, and passing a hand caressingly over
her hair, as she stood close at his side. "The
fact is, I am very glad of the companionship
of you both."</p>

<p>"And we are both thankful to hear you say
it, I am sure," returned Lucilla, in a
sprightly tone, and with a bright, loving look
up into his eyes. "I'd be heart-broken if I
thought my father didn't love me enough to
care to have me near him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I should be much distressed if I had
reason to believe my daughter didn't care to
be near me. If Grace were as strong and
healthy as you are, it would double the pleasure
to have her with us. She has gone to her
stateroom, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, and most of the others have
retired to their rooms, too. Dr. Harold and
Chester are playing a game of chess, and so
will hardly miss Eva and me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; so we will take our promenade
undisturbed by anxiety about them,"
laughed the Captain, offering an arm to each.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful evening; the moon was
shining in a clear sky and making a silvery
pathway upon the waters.</p>

<p>"Where do you suppose Max is now, father?"
asked Evelyn, with a slight sigh.</p>

<p>"Probably in Washington; though it is
possible he may have received his orders and
gone aboard his vessel."</p>

<p>"And doubtless he is thinking of you, Eva,
as you are of him," said Lucilla, speaking in
low, tender tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"No doubt of it," said their father, "for he
is very fond of his sweet, young wife. As
we all are, daughter dear," he added, softly
patting the small, white hand resting upon
his arm.</p>

<p>"Dear father," she said, with emotion, "it
is so kind in you to give me the fatherly affection
I have so missed and longed for in
years past."</p>

<p>"And daughterly affection from you is an
adequate return," he said pleasantly. "I expect
to enjoy that in all this winter's wanderings
by sea and land."</p>

<p>"Wanderings which I am very glad to be
allowed to share," she said; and then they
talked of the various places they expected to
visit while on this winter trip.</p>

<p>At length Evelyn, saying it was high time
for her to join Grace in the stateroom they
shared together, said good-night and returned
to the cabin, but Lucilla delayed her
departure a little longer&mdash;it was so pleasant
to have her father all to herself for a bit of
private chat before retiring for the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>They paced the deck silently for a few
moments, then she said: "Father, I have
thought a good deal of that talk we had in
our Bible lesson some time ago, about the
second coming of Christ. Do you think it&mdash;his
coming&mdash;is very near?"</p>

<p>"It may be, daughter. The signs of the
times seem to indicate its approach. Jesus
said, 'Of that day and hour knoweth no man,
no, not the angels of heaven, but My Father
only.' He has given us signs, however, by
which we may know that it is near; and
judging by them we may, I think, know that
it is not very far off now."</p>

<p>"Then, papa, doesn't it seem as if we
ought to be busied with religious duties all
the time?"</p>

<p>"I think whatever duties the Lord gives us
in His Providence may, in some sense, be
called religious duties&mdash;for me, for instance,
the care of wife, children and dependents.
We are to go on with household and family
duties, those to the poor and needy in our
neighborhood; also to take such part as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
can in the work of the church at home and
for foreign missions, and so forth; all this,
remembering his command, 'Occupy till I
come,' and endeavoring to be ready to meet
him with joy when he comes."</p>

<p>"And isn't it a very important part trying to
win souls to Christ?"</p>

<p>"It is, indeed, and 'he that winneth souls
is wise.' Leading a truly Christlike life may
often win them to join us in being his disciples,
even though we refrain from any
word of exhortation; though there are times
when we should not refrain from giving that
also."</p>

<p>"As you did to me, father," she said, with
a loving look up into his face. "Oh, I shall
try to be a winner of souls. The Bible makes
the way clear, again and again, in a very few
words. You know it tells us Jesus said to
Nicodemus, 'God so loved the world, that He
gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever
believeth in Him should not perish, but have
everlasting life.'"</p>

<p>"Yes; and Peter said to Cornelius and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
kinsmen and friends, after telling them of
Jesus, 'To Him give all the prophets witness,
that through His name whosoever believeth
in Him shall receive remission of
sins.' And Paul and Silas, when asked by
the jailor, 'Sirs, what must I do to be saved?'
replied, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
and thou shalt be saved.' Salvation is God's
free gift, without money and without price.
One must believe in His divinity, His ability
and willingness to save, taking salvation at
His hands as a free, unmerited gift. But
now, dear child," he added, taking her in his
arms, with a fond caress, "it is time for you
and that not very strong husband of yours to
be seeking your nest for the night. 'The
Lord bless thee, and keep thee; the Lord
make His face shine upon thee, and be gracious
unto thee; the Lord lift up His countenance
upon thee, and give thee peace.'" he
added in solemn tones, laying a hand tenderly
upon her head as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear father," she said, in
tones half tremulous with emotion, "I do so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
love that blessing from your lips. And Chester
and I both think I have the best father in
the world."</p>

<p>"It is pleasant to have you think that," he
returned, with a smile and another caress,
"but no doubt there are many fathers in the
world quite as good, kind and affectionate as
yours; perhaps if my daughters were less affectionate
and obedient than they are, they
might find their father more stern and severe.
Now, good-night&mdash;and may you have
peaceful sleep undisturbed by troubled
dreams."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning was bright and clear,
the air so much warmer than that which had
been left behind on their own shores, that
one and all repaired to the deck after breakfast,
and preferred to remain there during
the greater part of the day. Mr. Horace
Dinsmore, his wife and daughter were sitting
near together, the ladies occupied with
some crocheting, and Mr. Dinsmore with a
book in hand, which he did not seem to be
reading, when Elsie and Ned Raymond, who
had been gamboling about the deck, came
dancing up to them with a request for "more
about Bermuda."</p>

<p>"You don't want to be surprised by the
pretty things you will see there, eh?" queried
their grandpa.</p>

<p>"No, sir; we want to hear about them first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and see them afterward; if it isn't troubling
you too much," said Elsie, with a coaxing
look up into his face.</p>

<p>"Well, considering that you are my great-grandchildren,
I think I must search my
memory for something interesting on the
subject. There are many picturesque creeks
and bays. There are four pretty large islands&mdash;Bermuda,
the largest, being fifteen miles
long. The strange shapes of the islands and
the number of spacious lagoons make it necessary
to travel about them almost entirely in
boats; which is very pleasant, as you glide
along under a beautiful blue sky and through
waters so clear that you can see even to their
lowest depths, where the fish sport among the
coral rocks, and exquisitely variegated shells
abound."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall like that!" exclaimed Elsie.
"Are the fish handsome, too, grandpa?"</p>

<p>"Some of them are strikingly so," he replied.
"One called the parrot-fish is of a
green color as brilliant as that of his bird
namesake. His scales are as green as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
fresh grass of spring-time, and each one is
bordered by a pale brown line. His tail is
banded with nearly every color of the rainbow,
and his fins are pink."</p>

<p>"Is he good to eat, grandpa?" asked
Ned.</p>

<p>"No, his flesh is bitter and poisonous to
man and probably to other fishes. So they
let him well alone."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose he's glad of that,"
laughed Ned. "The more I hear about Bermuda,
grandpa, the gladder I am that we are
going there."</p>

<p>"Yes; and you may well be thankful that
you have so good and kind a father, and that
he owns this fine yacht."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I am that; but I'd rather be his
son than anybody else's if he didn't own anything
but me."</p>

<p>"And I'm just as pleased to be his daughter,"
said Elsie.</p>

<p>"And I to be his grandfather-in-law,"
added Mr. Dinsmore, with comically grave
look and tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir; Grandpa Travilla would have
been his&mdash;papa's&mdash;father-in-law if he had
lived, wouldn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and almost as old as I am. He was
my dear, good friend, and I gave him my
daughter to be his wife."</p>

<p>"That was you, grandma, wasn't it?"
asked Ned, turning to Mrs. Travilla.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," she said, with a smile and a
sigh, "and if he had stayed with us until now
you would have loved him as you do Grandpa
Dinsmore."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, grandma," came softly and
sweetly from the lips of both children.</p>

<p>There was a moment of subdued silence,
then Grandpa Dinsmore went on.</p>

<p>"There are many pretty creatures to be
seen in the waters about Bermuda. There
is a kind of fish called angels, that look very
bright and pretty. They have a beautiful
blue stripe along the back, and long streamers
of golden yellow, and they swim very
gracefully about. But they are not so good
as they are pretty. They pester the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
fishes by nibbling at them, and so, often, get
into a quarrel, fighting with a long, sharp
spine which they have on each gill-cover,
making ugly wounds with it on those they
are fighting.</p>

<p>"Among the outer reefs we will, perhaps,
see a speckled moray. He looks like a common
eel, except that his body is dark-green
flecked with bright yellow spots, which
makes him quite a handsome fellow. There
is a fish the Bermuda fishermen call the
'Spanish hogfish,' and when asked why they
give it that name they say, 'Why, sir, you
see it lazes around just like a hog, and carries
the Spanish colors.'"</p>

<p>"Spanish colors? What are they, grandpa?"
queried Ned.</p>

<p>"The fish," said Mr. Dinsmore, "is brownish
red from his head to the middle of his
body, and from there to the end of his tail a
bright yellow; and those are the colors of the
Spanish flag."</p>

<p>"I'm glad we are going to Bermuda," remarked
Elsie, with a happy little sigh, "for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
I'm sure there must be a great deal there
worth seeing."</p>

<p>"And your father is just the kind of man
to help you to a sight of all such things," responded
Mr. Dinsmore.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Elsie, "papa never seems
to think it too much trouble to do anything
to give us pleasure."</p>

<p>"Ah, what father would, if he had such a
dear little girl and boy as mine?" queried a
manly voice just behind them, while a gentle
hand was laid caressingly on Elsie's head.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, I didn't know you were so
near," she exclaimed, with a laugh and a
blush. "Wont you sit down with us? Grandpa
Dinsmore has been telling us very interesting
things about Bermuda."</p>

<p>"And papa can probably tell some that
will be more interesting," remarked Mr.
Dinsmore, as the Captain took possession of
Elsie's seat and drew her to one upon his
knee.</p>

<p>That suited the little maid exactly; in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
opinion no seat was more desirable than
"papa's knee."</p>

<p>"Now, papa, we're ready to hear all you
know about Bermuda," said Ned, with a look
of eager interest.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are more ready to hear than
I to tell," the Captain answered, with an
amused smile. "At any rate, I want, first, to
hear what you have been told, lest I should
waste my time and strength in repeating it."</p>

<p>The children eagerly repeated what had
been told them, the Captain added a few
more facts about the beautiful things to be
seen in the clear Bermuda waters&mdash;the coral
reefs and the plants and animals that cover
them; then the call to dinner came, and all
left the deck for the dining-saloon.</p>

<p>Almost the whole party were on deck
again immediately upon leaving the table.
The older ones were scattered here and there
in couples or groups, but Elsie and Ned
sauntered along together chatting in low
tones, as if not wanting to be overheard by
the older people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I am sorry," sighed Elsie, in reply
to something her brother had said; "Christmas
is such a delightful time at home, and,
of course, we can't expect to have one here
on the yacht."</p>

<p>"No," said Ned, brightening, "but, of
course, we can give Christmas gifts to each
other, if&mdash;if we get to Bermuda in time to
buy things. I s'pose there must be stores
there."</p>

<p>"Surely, I should think. I'll ask mamma
or papa about it."</p>

<p>"Have you any money?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I have two dollars I've been saving
up to buy Christmas gifts. How much have
you?"</p>

<p>"Fifty cents. It isn't much, but it will
buy some little things, I guess."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course it will. But, oh, Ned,
Christmas comes Monday. To-morrow is
Sunday; so we couldn't do any shopping,
even if we were on the land; and we may as
well give it up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, but we are having a very good time
here on the 'Dolphin,' aren't we, Elsie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! and it would be really
shameful for us to fret and worry over missing
the usual Christmas gifts and pleasures."</p>

<p>The two had been so absorbed in the subject
they were discussing that they had not
noticed an approaching step, but now a hand
was laid on a shoulder of each, and their father's
loved voice asked, in tender tones:
"What is troubling my little son and daughter?
Tell papa, and perhaps he may find a
way out of the woods."</p>

<p>"Yes, papa; they are not very thick
woods," laughed Elsie. "It is only that we
are sorry we can't have any Christmas times
this winter, or remember anybody with gifts,
because we can't go to any stores to buy anything."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure of all that, daughter?"
he asked, with a smile, smoothing her hair
caressingly as he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought I was, but perhaps my father
knows better," she answered, with a pleased
little laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, I think a man of my age ought to
know more than a little girl of yours. Don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed! and I know my father
knows many, many times more than I do. Is
there any way for us to get gifts for all these
dear folks on the yacht with us, or for any of
them, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remembered Christmas when we
were getting ready to leave home, and provided
such gifts as seemed desirable for each
one of my family to give to others. I will
give you each your share to-night before you
go to your berths, and you can decide how
you will distribute them&mdash;to whom you will
give each one."</p>

<p>"But, papa, I&mdash;&mdash;" Elsie paused, blushing
and confused.</p>

<p>"Well, dear child, what is it?" asked her
father, in gentle, affectionate tones.</p>

<p>"I was thinking, papa, that they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
hardly be our gifts when you bought them
and with your own money, not ours."</p>

<p>"But I give them to you, daughter, and
you may keep or give them away, just as you
like. That makes them your gift quite as
truly as if they had been bought with your
own pocket money. Does it not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, papa, so it seems to me, and I
know it does since you say so," exclaimed
Elsie joyously; Ned joining in with, "Oh,
that's just splendid, papa! You are the best
father in the world! Elsie and I both think
so."</p>

<p>"Well, it is very pleasant to have my children
think so, however mistaken they may
be," his father said, with a smile and an affectionate
pat on the little boy's shoulder.
"Well, my dears, suppose we go down at once
and attend to these matters. It will be better
now than later, I think, and not so likely to
keep you from getting to sleep in good season
to-night."</p>

<p>The children gave an eager, joyful assent,
and their father led them down to the stateroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
occupied by Violet and himself, and
opening a trunk there, brought to light a
quantity of pretty things&mdash;ribbons, laces,
jewelry, books and pictures; also cards with
the names of the intended recipients to be
attached to the gifts, as the young givers
might see fit.</p>

<p>That work was undertaken at once, their
father helping them in their selection and
attaching the cards for them. It did not take
very long, and they returned to the deck in
gay spirits.</p>

<p>"For what purpose did you two children
take papa down below? or was it he who took
you?" asked Lucilla, laughingly.</p>

<p>"I think it was papa who took us," said
Elsie, smiling up into his face as she spoke.
"Wasn't it, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "and whoever asks about
it may be told it was father's secret conference."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Lucilla, "it is a secret then, is
it? I don't want to pry into other people's
affairs; so I withdraw my question."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps papa intends to take his other
children&mdash;you and me, Lu&mdash;down in their
turn," remarked Grace, laughingly, for she
was sitting near her father, and had overheard
the bit of chat.</p>

<p>"I really had not thought of doing so,"
said the Captain, "but it is a good idea.
Come, now, both of you," he added, leading
the way. "I suppose you two have not forgotten
that to-morrow will be Sunday and
the next day Christmas?" he said, inquiringly,
as they reached the saloon.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, papa; you know you helped us,
before we left home, in selecting gifts for
Mamma Vi and the children and others,"
said Grace. "But how are we going to keep
Christmas here on the yacht?"</p>

<p>"Pretty much as if we were at home on
the land," he answered, with a smile. "There
is a Christmas tree lying down in the hold. I
intend having it set up here early Monday
morning, and some of the early risers will
perhaps trim it before the late ones are out
of bed. Then it can be viewed, and the gifts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
distributed when all are ready to take part
in the work and fun. Now, if you wish
I will show you the gifts I have prepared
for my family&mdash;not including yourselves,"
he interpolated, with a smile. "Our
guests and servants here and the crew of the
vessel."</p>

<p>The offer was gladly accepted, the gifts
viewed with great interest and pleasure, the
girls chatting meanwhile with affectionate
and respectful familiarity with their loved
father.</p>

<p>"I like your plan, father, very much indeed,"
said Lucilla; "and as it is easy and
natural for me to wake and rise early, I
should like to help with the trimming of the
tree, if you are willing."</p>

<p>"Certainly, daughter, I shall be glad to
have you help&mdash;and to put the gifts intended
for you on afterward," he added, with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and perhaps your daughters
may treat you in the same way," she returned
demurely. "I suppose you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
hardly blame them for following your example?"</p>

<p>"I ought not to, since example is said to
be better than precept. We will put these
things away now, go back to our friends on
deck, and try to forget gifts until Christmas
morning."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> on former voyages on the "Dolphin,"
Sabbath day was kept religiously by all on
board the vessel. Religious services&mdash;prayer,
praise and the reading of a sermon&mdash;were
held on deck, for the benefit of all, after
which there was a Bible lesson led by Mr.
Milburn, the subject being the birth of Jesus
and the visits of the wise men from the east;
also the story of Bethlehem's shepherds and
their angel visitants followed by their visit
to the infant Saviour.</p>

<p>The children went to bed early that night
that&mdash;as they said&mdash;Christmas might come
the sooner. Then the Captain, his older
daughters, Chester, and Harold, had a little
chat about what should be done in the morning.
The young men were urgent that their
assistance should be accepted in the matter of
setting up and trimming the tree; the girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
also put in a petition for the privilege of
helping with the work.</p>

<p>To Lucilla their father answered, "You
may, as I have said, for you are naturally an
early bird, so that I think it cannot hurt
you." Then turning to Grace, "I hardly
think it would do for you, daughter dear;
but we will let your doctor decide it," turning
inquiringly to Harold.</p>

<p>"If her doctor is to decide it, he says emphatically
No," said Harold, with a very
loverlike look down into the sweet face of his
betrothed; "she will enjoy the rest of the day
much better for taking her usual morning
nap."</p>

<p>"You and papa are very kind; almost too
kind," returned Grace, between a smile and
a sigh. "But I think you are a good doctor,
so I will follow your advice and papa's
wishes."</p>

<p>"That is right, my darling," responded
her father, "and I hope you will have
your reward in feeling well through the
day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"If she doesn't, she can discharge her doctor,"
said Lucilla in a mirthful tone.</p>

<p>"You seem inclined to be hard upon doctors,
Lu," remarked Harold, gravely; "but
one of these days you may be glad of the
services of even such an one as I."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is quite possible; and even now
I am right glad to have my husband under
your care; and I'm free to say that if your
patients don't improve, I don't think it will
be fair to blame it&mdash;their failure&mdash;on the
doctor."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said; "should you need
doctoring on this trip of ours, just call upon
me and I'll do the best for you that I can."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you would," laughed Lucilla,
"but I'll do my best to keep out of your
hands."</p>

<p>"That being your intention, let me advise
you to go at once to your bed," returned Harold,
glancing at his watch. Then all said
good-night and dispersed to their rooms.</p>

<p>At early dawn the three gentlemen were
again in the saloon overseeing the setting up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of the Christmas tree, then arranging upon
it a multitude of gifts from one to another of
the "Dolphin's" passengers, and some token
of remembrance for each one of the crew;
for it was not in the kind heart of the Captain
ever to forget or neglect any one in his
employ.</p>

<p>The other passengers, older and younger,
except Lucilla, who was with them in time to
help with the trimming of the tree, did not
emerge from their staterooms until the sun
was up, shining gloriously upon the sea, in
which the waves were gently rising and falling.
All were fond of gazing upon the sea,
but this morning their first attention was
given to the tree, which seemed to have
grown up in a night in the saloon, where
they were used to congregate mornings, evenings
and stormy days. All gathered round it
and viewed its treasures with appreciative remarks;
then the Captain, with Chester's and
Harold's assistance, distributed the gifts.</p>

<p>Every one had several and seemed well
pleased with them. The one that gave Eva<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the greatest pleasure had been left for her
by her young husband; it was an excellent
miniature likeness of himself set in gold and
diamonds. She appreciated the beautiful
setting, but the correct and speaking likeness
was far more to her.</p>

<p>Near the tree stood a table loaded with
fruits and confections of various kinds, very
tempting in appearance. Ned hailed it with
an expression of pleasure, but his father
bade him let the sweets alone until after he
had eaten his breakfast.</p>

<p>The words had scarcely left the Captain's
lips when a voice was heard, apparently coming
from the skylight overhead: "Say, Pete,
d'ye see them goodies piled up on that thar
table down thar? My, but they looks
temptin'."</p>

<p>"Yes," seemed to come from another
voice, "wouldn't I like to git in thar and
help myself? It's odd and real mean how
some folks has all the good things and other
folks none."</p>

<p>"Course it is. But, oh, I'll tell you. They'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
be goin' out to breakfast presently, then let's
go down thar where the goodies is, and help,
ourselves."</p>

<p>"Yes, let's."</p>

<p>Everybody in the saloon had stopped talking
and seemed to be listening in surprise to
the colloquy of the two stowaways&mdash;for such
they apparently were&mdash;but now Ned broke
the silence: "Why, how did they get on
board? Must be stowaways and have been
in the hold all this time. Oh, I guess they
are hungry enough by this time; so no wonder
they want the candies and things."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Cousin Ronald can tell us something
about them," laughed Lucilla.</p>

<p>"Acquaintances of mine, you think, lassie?" sniffed
the old gentleman. "Truly, you
are most complimentary. But I have no more
fancy for such trash than have you."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, now, cousin, I really don't imagine
those remarks were made by any very
bad or objectionable fellows," remarked Captain
Raymond, in a tone of amusement.</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Dinsmore, "we certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
should not be hard on them if they are poor
and hungry."</p>

<p>"Which they must be if they have been
living in the hold ever since we left our native
shores," laughed Violet.</p>

<p>"Oh, now, I know, it was just Cousin Ronald,
and not any real person," cried Ned,
dancing about in delight.</p>

<p>"And so I'm not a real person?" said Mr.
Lilburn, in a deeply hurt tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cousin Ronald, I didn't mean that,"
said Ned, penitently, "only that you weren't
two boys, but just pretending to be."</p>

<p>At that everybody laughed, and Mr. Lilburn
said: "Very true; I never was two boys
and am no longer even one. Well, I think
you and all of us may feel safe in leaving the
good things on the table there when we are
called to breakfast, for I am sure those fellows
will not meddle with them."</p>

<p>The summons to the table had just
sounded, and now was obeyed by all with
cheerful alacrity. Everybody was in fine
spirits, the meal an excellent one, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
partook of it with appetite, while the flow of
conversation was steady, bright and mirthful.</p>

<p>They had their morning service directly
after the meal, then went upon deck and to
their surprise found they were in sight of
Bermuda. They were glad to see it, though
the voyage had been a pleasant one to all
and really beneficial to the ailing ones, for
whose benefit it was undertaken more particularly
than for the enjoyment of the
others. Also it was hoped and expected that
their sojourn in and about the islands would
be still more helpful and delightful; and so
indeed it proved.</p>

<p>They tarried in that neighborhood several
weeks, spending most of their time on
the vessel, or in her small boats&mdash;many of
the water-ways being too narrow and shallow
to be traversed by the yacht, but going from
place to place on the land in a way to see all
that was interesting there.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a lovely moonlight evening; the
"Dolphin's" Captain and all his family and
passengers were gathered together upon the
deck. It had been a day of sight-seeing and
wandering from place to place about the
islands, and they were weary enough to fully
enjoy the rest and quiet now vouchsafed
them.</p>

<p>Captain Raymond broke a momentary silence
by saying: "I hope, my friends, that
you can all feel that you have had a pleasant
sojourn in and about these islands?"</p>

<p>"Indeed we have," replied several voices.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it," returned the Captain,
heartily; "and now the question is,
Shall we tarry here longer or go on our southward
way to visit other places, where we will
escape the rigors of winter in our more
northern homes?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>No one spoke for a moment; then Mr.
Dinsmore said: "Let the majority decide. I
am perfectly satisfied to go on or to stay
here, as you, Captain, and they may wish."</p>

<p>"And I echo my husband's sentiments and
feelings," remarked Mrs. Rose Dinsmore,
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"And you, mother?" asked the Captain,
turning to Mrs. Travilla.</p>

<p>"I, too, am entirely willing to go or stay,
as others may wish," she replied, in her own
sweet voice.</p>

<p>"And you, Evelyn?" asked the Captain,
turning to her.</p>

<p>"I feel that it would be delightful either
to go or stay, father," she answered, with a
smile and a blush.</p>

<p>The others were quite as non-committal,
but after some further chat on the subject it
was decided that they would leave Bermuda
the next morning, and, taking a southerly
course, probably make Porto Rico their next
halting place.</p>

<p>As usual, Lucilla woke at an early hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Evidently the vessel was still stationary, and
anxious to see it start she rose and made her
toilet very quietly, lest she should disturb
her still sleeping husband, then left the room
and stole noiselessly through the saloon up to
the deck, where she found her father overseeing
the lifting of the anchor.</p>

<p>"Ah, good-morning, daughter," he said,
with a smile, as she reached his side. "You
are an early bird as usual," ending his sentence
with a clasp of his arm about her waist
and a kiss upon her lips.</p>

<p>"Yes, papa," she laughed, "who wouldn't
be an early bird to get such a token of love
from such a father as mine?"</p>

<p>"And what father wouldn't be ready and
glad to bestow it upon such a daughter as
mine?" he responded, repeating his loving
caress. "You have enjoyed your trip thus
far, daughter, have you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, papa. We are bound for
Porto Rico now, are we not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think that will be our first stopping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
place; though perhaps we may not land
at all, but merely sail round it, viewing it
from the sea."</p>

<p>"And perhaps you may treat Cuba in the
same way?"</p>

<p>"Very possibly. I shall act in regard to
both as the majority of my passengers may
wish."</p>

<p>The anchor was now up, and the vessel
gliding through the water. The Captain and
Lucilla paced the deck to and fro, taking a
farewell look at the receding islands and
talking of the pleasure they had found in
visiting them, particularly in exploring the
many creeks and bays, with their clear
waters so full of beautiful shells and fish, so
different from those to be found in their
land.</p>

<p>"I shall always look back with pleasure
upon this visit to Bermuda, father," Lucilla
said, with a grateful smile up into his eyes.</p>

<p>"I am very glad you have enjoyed it,
daughter," he replied; "as I think every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of our party has. And I am hoping that our
wanderings further to the south may prove
not less interesting and enjoyable."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I hope so. I shall feel great interest
in looking upon Cuba and Porto Rico&mdash;particularly
the first&mdash;because of what
our men did and endured there in the late
war with Spain. How pleasant it was that
the Porto Ricans were so ready and glad to
be freed from the domination of Spain and
taken into our Union."</p>

<p>Just then Harold joined them, and with
him came little Ned. Pleasant good-mornings
were exchanged. Then others of their party
followed, two or three at a time, till all
were on deck enjoying the sweet morning
air and the view of the fast-receding islands.
Then came the call to breakfast, followed
by the morning service of prayer and
praise, and after that they returned to the
deck.</p>

<p>As usual, the children were soon beside
their loved grandmother, Mrs. Elsie Travilla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, dears, we have had a very good
time at Bermuda, haven't we?" she said,
smiling lovingly upon them.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Elsie. "Do you think
we will have as good a time where we are
going now?"</p>

<p>"I hope so, my dear. I believe Porto
Rico is to be the first land we touch at.
Would you like me to tell you something of
its beauties and its history?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, grandma," both children
answered, in a tone of eager assent, and she
began at once.</p>

<p>"The name&mdash;Porto Rico&mdash;was given it by
the Spaniards, and means 'The Gateway of
Wealth.' It was discovered by Columbus in
1493. It is about half as large as New Jersey.
Through its center is a range of mountains
called the Luquillo. The highest peak,
Yunque, can be seen from a distance of
sixty-eight miles. Porto Rico is a beautiful
island. The higher parts of the hills are
covered by forests; immense herds of cattle
are pastured on the plains. The land is fertile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and they raise cotton, corn, rice and almost
every kind of tropical fruit."</p>

<p>"Are there any rivers, grandma?" asked
Ned.</p>

<p>"Nine small ones," she answered.</p>

<p>"Are there any towns?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, quite a good many; large ones.
Ponce, the capital, has a good many thousands
of inhabitants, and some fine buildings.
San Juan, too, is quite a large place;
it stands on Morro Island, which forms the
north side of the harbor and is separated
from the mainland by a narrow creek called
the Channel of San Antonio. At the entrance
to San Juan's harbors is a lighthouse
on Morro Point. It is one hundred and
seventy-one feet above the sea, and its fixed
light is visible for eighteen miles over the
waters."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Ned, "let's watch out for it
when we are coming that near."</p>

<p>"It will be very well for you to do so," his
grandma said, with a smile; then went on
with her account of Porto Rico.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"The island has much to recommend it;
the climate is salubrious, and there are no
snakes or reptiles. It has valuable minerals,
too&mdash;gold, copper, lead; also coal. San Juan
is lighted by both gas and electricity.</p>

<p>"The Spaniards were very cruel to the
poor Indians who inhabited Porto Rico
when Columbus discovered it. It is said that
in a hundred years they had killed five hundred
thousand of men, women and children."</p>

<p>"Oh, how dreadful!" exclaimed Elsie.
"And they killed so, <i>so</i> many of the poor natives
in Peru and in Mexico. I don't wonder
that God has let their nation grow so poor
and weak."</p>

<p>"The Porto Ricans were tired of being
governed by them when we began our war
with Spain to help the poor Cubans to get
free," continued Grandma Elsie. "Our government
and people did not know that, but
thought Porto Rico should be taken from
Spain, as well as Cuba. So as soon as Santiago
was taken, a strong force was sent
against Ponce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"The 'Wasp' was the first vessel to arrive.
It had been expected that they would have to
shell the city, but as the 'Wasp' steamed close
to the shore a great crowd of citizens could
be seen gathered there. They were not behaving
like enemies, and the troops on the
'Wasp' were at a loss to understand what it
meant; therefore, the gunners stood ready to
fire at an instant's warning, when Ensign
Rowland Curtin was sent ashore bearing a
flag of truce, four men with him.</p>

<p>"The citizens were cheering as if frantic
with joy over their coming, and as soon as
they landed overwhelmed them with gifts of
tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, bananas, and
other good things."</p>

<p>"Oh, wasn't that nice!" exclaimed Elsie.
"I think they showed their good sense in preferring
to be ruled by our people rather than
by the Spaniards."</p>

<p>"As soon as the people could be calm
enough to listen," continued Grandma Elsie,
"Ensign Curtin announced that he had come
to demand the surrender of the city and port,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and asked to see the civil or military authorities.</p>

<p>"Some of the civil officials were there, but
they could not surrender the city, as that
must be the act of the military powers. There
was a telephone at hand, and the ensign ordered
a message sent to Colonel San Martin,
the commandant, telling him that if he did
not come forward and surrender the city in
the course of half an hour, it would be bombarded.</p>

<p>"The garrison had been, and still were, debating
among themselves what they should
do, but as soon as they heard of this message
they began looting the stores and shops,
cramming underwear and clothing upon
their backs and in their trousers, to check
and hold the bullets which they were certain
the Americans would send after them, as
they scampered off.</p>

<p>"Ensign Curtin went back to his vessel,
and, soon after, Commander C. H. Davis, of
the 'Dixie,' was rowed ashore. There a note
was handed him from Colonel San Martin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
asking on what terms he demanded the surrender
of the city. He answered that it must
be unconditional. At the request of the commandant,
however, he made the terms a little
different. Then the padded men of the garrison
waddled out of town, leaving one hundred
and fifty rifles and fourteen thousand
rounds of ammunition behind.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Haines, commanding the
marines of the 'Dixie,' landed and hoisted the
Stars and Stripes over the custom-house at
the port of Ponce, the onlookers cheering
most heartily. After that, Lieutenant Murdoch
and Surgeon Heiskell rode to the city,
three miles distant, where the people fairly
went wild with joy, dancing and shouting,
'<i>Viva los Americanos. Viva Puerto Rico
libre.</i>'"</p>

<p>"Sensible folks I think they were to be so
glad to get away from Spain and into the
United States," remarked Ned, with a
pleased smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think they were," said Grandma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Elsie, "for it was gaining liberty&mdash;freedom
from most oppressive tyranny."</p>

<p>She had begun her talk to the two children
alone, but now quite a group had gathered
about them&mdash;Dr. Harold Travilla and Grace
Raymond, Chester and Lucilla Dinsmore
and Mrs. Evelyn Raymond.</p>

<p>"I am very desirous to see Porto Rico,"
said Harold. "It must be a garden spot&mdash;fertile
and beautiful. As we draw near
it I mean to be on the lookout for El
Yunque."</p>

<p>"What's that, uncle?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"The highest point of land on the island,
nearly four thousand feet high. The meaning
of the name is the anvil."</p>

<p>"Porto Rico being in the torrid zone, it
must have a very hot climate. The weather
must have been very oppressive for our
troops&mdash;taking it in the height of summer,"
remarked Grace.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Grandma Elsie; "but the climate
is more agreeable than that of Cuba<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
or of many places farther north, because of
the land breezes that prevail, coming from
both north and south."</p>

<p>"It is a beautiful and delightful island,"
remarked Harold. "I have often thought I
should, some day, pay it a visit."</p>

<p>"Are we likely to land there?" asked his
mother.</p>

<p>"I do not know, mother," he answered;
"but I presume the Captain will say that
shall be just as his passengers wish."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure father will say we may
all do exactly as we please," said Lucilla;
"go ashore, or stay quietly on the yacht while
others go and return."</p>

<p>"It cannot be now the delightful place to
visit that it was before the hurricane of last
August," remarked Chester.</p>

<p>"No," said Grandma Elsie, "and I think
I, for one, do not care to land on the island
until they have had more time to recover
from the fearful effects of that terrible
storm."</p>

<p>"What mischief did it do, grandma?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
asked Ned; "were there houses destroyed
and people killed?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a great many," she answered, with
a sigh. "I have read that in one district it
was estimated that the damage done to
houses and crops would reach nine hundred
thousand in gold, and that in the valley of
the Rio de Grande over a thousand persons
disappeared, and were supposed to have been
drowned by the sudden rise and overflow of
the river."</p>

<p>"And you, mother, I know gave liberally
to help repair the damages," said Harold.</p>

<p>"I was better able than many others who
may have been quite as willing," she responded,
"and I think I can do still more, if
I find the need is still urgent."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother dear, you seem always ready
and glad to help any one who needs it," said
Harold, giving her a look full of proud, loving
admiration.</p>

<p>Captain Raymond had drawn near the
group just in time to hear Harold's last remark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quite true, Harold," he said, "but who is
to be the happy recipient of mother's bounty
this time?"</p>

<p>"We were talking of the losses of the unfortunate
Porto Ricans in last August's fearful
storm," replied Harold. "Mother, as you
know, has already given help, and expresses
herself as ready to do more if it is needed."</p>

<p>"And will do it, I know," said the Captain.</p>

<p>"I hope, though, that my dear grandma
wont give everything away and have nothing
left for herself," said Elsie Raymond, with
a loving look up into Grandma Elsie's face.</p>

<p>"I should not like to have her do that
either," the Captain said, with a smile. "But
the Bible tells us, 'He that hath pity upon
the poor, lendeth unto the Lord, and that
which he hath given will he pay him
again.'"</p>

<p>"A promise that none of us need be afraid
to trust," said Grandma Elsie, with a happy
look and smile. "Do you think of visiting
any part of the island, Captain?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"That shall be as my passengers wish," he
replied; "we can consider the matter and
talk it over while on our way there. My present
plan is to go directly to San Juan. We
may stay some hours or days there, those going
ashore who wish, the others remaining on
the vessel. We may make the circuit of the
island, entirely or in part, keeping near
enough to the land to get a pretty good view
of its beauties."</p>

<p>"Will this be your first visit to Porto Rico,
Captain?" queried Chester.</p>

<p>"No, I paid it a flying visit some years
ago; and then went up the mountains to
Caguas and visited the dark cave of Aguas
Buenas."</p>

<p>"Did it pay?" asked Chester.</p>

<p>"Hardly. The outside journey, though
difficult, did pay, but the darkness of the
cave, the multitudes of bats flying in your
face, and the danger of the guides' torches
going out, leaving you unable to find your
way to the opening, make the expedition anything
but safe or pleasant. I shall never venture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
in there again or advise any friend to
do so."</p>

<p>"Are you going to take us to Cuba, too,
papa?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"If my passengers wish to go there."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think they will; this one does, anyhow,"
laughed the little girl.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it would be pleasanter to
visit it after it has had time to recover from
the war?" asked Lucilla.</p>

<p>"Perhaps papa will bring us a second time
after that?" Elsie said, with a smile up into
his face.</p>

<p>"That is quite possible," he answered, returning
the smile.</p>

<p>"Please, papa, tell us something about
Cuba now, won't you?" pleaded Ned.</p>

<p>"Very willingly, if you all care to hear
it," returned the Captain, and a general assent
being given, he went on: "I think much
of it you will all understand better, if told
you while looking upon the scenes where it
occurred. However, since you wish it, I
shall tell at least a part of the story now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Doubtless, you all know that Cuba was
discovered by Columbus on October 28,
1492. He said of it at one time: 'It is the
most beautiful land that eyes ever beheld';
at another: 'Its waters are filled with excellent
ports, its rivers are magnificent and profound';
and yet again, 'As far as the day
surpasses night in brightness and splendor, it
surpasses all other countries.'</p>

<p>"He found it beautiful not only along the
shore where he first landed, but in the interior
also; flowers, fruits, maize and cotton in
their abundance showed the fertility of the
soil. And it was inhabited by a peaceful people
who gave him and his men a glad welcome,
imagining them to be superior beings,
and little dreaming how they were to suffer at
their hands. Columbus describes them as tall
and straight, like the natives of North America,
of tawny complexion, and gentle disposition,
being easy to influence by their masters.
They were a naturally indolent race, which
was not strange, considering how easy it was
for them to have a comfortable living with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
very little exertion; there were abundance of
wild fruits, and corn and cotton could be
raised with little exertion; abundance of fish
could be easily obtained from the waters, and
if they wanted meat, a little animal resembling
a rat in appearance, but tasting like a
rabbit, could be had for the hunting. So it
would seem they lived easy, contented and
peaceful lives; and why should the Spaniards
think they had a right to rob and enslave
them."</p>

<p>"Why indeed," exclaimed Lucilla. "The
Indians&mdash;if able to do so&mdash;would have had
just as good a right to go over to Spain and
enslave them."</p>

<p>"But with the Spaniards might made
right," said Chester.</p>

<p>"But there were only a few Spaniards
with Columbus and a very great many natives
on these islands," remarked little Elsie,
in a puzzled tone. "I wonder they didn't
kill the Spaniards as soon as they began trying
to make slaves of them."</p>

<p>"At first," said her father, "they took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Spaniards to be a race of superior beings,
and gladly welcomed them to their shores. It
would, doubtless, have been easy for them to
crush that handful of worn-out men, and no
doubt they would if they could have foreseen
what their conduct toward them would be;
but they mistook them for friends, and
treated them as such. One cazique gave
them a grand reception and feasted them
amid songs and their rude music. Games,
dancing and singing followed, then they
were conducted to separate lodges and
each provided with a cotton hammock, that
proved a delightful couch to pass the night
upon."</p>

<p>"And the Spaniards took all that kindness
at the hands of those poor things and repaid
them with the basest robbery and cruelty,"
exclaimed Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes," said her father; "they even repaid
that most generous hospitality by seizing
some of the youngest, strongest and most
beautiful of their entertainers and carrying
them to Spain, where they were paraded before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the vulgar gaze of the jeering crowd,
then sold into slavery.</p>

<p>"One of their venerable caziques gave to
Columbus, when he came the second time to
the island, a basket of luscious fruit, saying
to him, as he did so: 'Whether you are divinities
or mortal men, we know not. You
have come into these countries with a force,
against which, were we inclined to resist, it
would be folly. We are all, therefore, at your
mercy; but if you are men, subject to morality,
like ourselves, you cannot be unapprised
that after this life there is another, wherein
a very different portion is allotted to good
and bad men. If, then, you expect to die,
and believe, with us, that every one is to be
rewarded in a future state according to his
conduct in the present, you will do no hurt
to those who do none to you.'"</p>

<p>"That old chief was certainly a very wise
man for a heathen," remarked Chester.</p>

<p>"And how strange that the Spaniards
could treat so shamefully such innocent and
friendly people," said Evelyn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," exclaimed Lucilla, "I think we
may all be thankful that there is no Spanish
blood in us."</p>

<p>"Which fact makes us the more to be
blamed if we indulge in oppression and
cruelty," said her father.</p>

<p>"Papa, did that old king live long enough
to see how very cruel the Spaniards were to
his people?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"That I cannot tell," replied the Captain,
"but by the time another ten years had
passed by, the natives of Cuba had learned
that the love of the Spaniards for gold was
too great ever to be satisfied, and that they
themselves could not be safe with the Spaniards
there; they were so alarmed that when
Diego Columbus sent an armed force of three
hundred men to begin to colonize Cuba, they
resisted their landing. But they, the Indians,
were only naked savages with frail
spears and wooden swords, while the invading
foes were old-world warriors who had been
trained on many a hard-fought battlefield,
armed with deadly weapons, protected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
plate armor, and having bloodhounds to help
in their cruel attempt to rob and subjugate
the rightful owners of the soil. So they
succeeded in their wicked designs; hundreds
of those poor Indians were killed in cold
blood, others spared to slavery worse than
death. From being free men they became
slaves to one of the most cruel and tyrannical
races of the world. And they were not only
abused there on their own island, but hundreds
of them were taken to Europe and sold
for slaves in the markets of Seville. That
was to raise money to pay the expenses of
their captors."</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed Ned, "the Spaniards
treated them as if they were just animals,
instead of people."</p>

<p>"Papa, were they&mdash;the Indians&mdash;heathen?" asked
Elsie.</p>

<p>"They had no images or altars, no temples,
but they believed in a future existence
and in a god living above the blue-domed
sky," replied the Captain. "But they knew
nothing of Jesus and the way of salvation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and it seems the Spaniards did not tell them
of Him or give them the Bible."</p>

<p>"No," said Grandma Elsie, "Rome did
not allow them the Bible for themselves."</p>

<p>"Are there a good many wild flowers in
Cuba, papa?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes; a great many, and of every color
and tint imaginable&mdash;flowers growing wild
in the woods. The foliage of the trees is
scarcely less beautiful, and their tops are
alive with birds of gayly-colored plumage.
I have been speaking of wild, uncultivated
land. The scene is even more inviting where
man has been at work transforming the wildwood
into cultivated fields; he has fenced
them off with stone walls, which have warm
russet-brown tints and are covered here and
there with vines and creepers bearing bright
flowers. The walks and avenues are bordered
with orange-trees in blossom and fruit at the
same time, both looking lovely in their setting
of deep green leaves. But you have seen
such in Louisiana."</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, and they are beautiful," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Elsie. "There must be a great deal worth
seeing in Cuba, but I'll not care to land on
it if you older people don't want to."</p>

<p>"Well, we will leave that question to be
decided in the future," the Captain said,
smiling down into the bright little face.</p>

<p>"I think I have read," said Evelyn, "that
Columbus at first thought Cuba not an island
but a part of the mainland?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Captain, "but the natives
assured him that it was an island; on
his second trip, however, in 1494, he reiterated
his previous belief and called the land
Juana, after Juan, the son of Ferdinand and
Isabella. Afterward he changed it to Fernandina,
in honor of Ferdinand; still later
to Santiago, the name of the patron saint of
Spain, after that to Ave Maria. But the
name Cuba clung to the island and was never
lost.</p>

<p>"The Indians there were a peaceable race.
They called themselves Ciboneyes. They had
nine independent caciques, and, as I believe
I have already told you, they believed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
supreme being and the immortality of the
soul."</p>

<p>"Really, they seem to me to have been
more Christian than the Spaniards who
came and robbed them of their lands and
their liberty," said Evelyn.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> "Dolphin" and her passengers and
crew reached Porto Rico in safety, having
made the voyage without detention or mishap.
The yacht lay in the harbor of San Juan
for nearly a week, while its passengers made
various little excursions here and there to
points of interest upon the island. Then the
yacht made its circuit, keeping near enough
to the shore for a good view of the land, in
which all were greatly interested&mdash;especially
in those parts where there had been some
fighting with the Spaniards in the late war.</p>

<p>"Now, father, you are going to take us to
Santiago next, are you not?" asked Lucilla,
as they steamed away from the Porto Rican
coast.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "I am satisfied that you
all take a particular interest in that place,
feeling that you would like to see the scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of the naval battle and perhaps to look from
a distance upon some of the places where
there was fighting on land."</p>

<p>"It will be interesting," said little Elsie,
"but, oh, how glad I am that the fighting is
all over!"</p>

<p>"As I am," said her father; "but if it
wasn't, I should not think of taking my family
and friends to the scene."</p>

<p>"That was a big battle," said Ned. "I'm
glad I'm going to see the place of the fight;
though I'd rather see Manila and its bay, because
Brother Max had a share in that fight.
Uncle Harold, you came pretty near having
a share in the Santiago one, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I was near enough to be in sight of some
of it," said Harold; "though not so near as
to some of the fighting on the land."</p>

<p>"That must have been a very exciting time
for you and your fellows," remarked Mr.
Lilburn.</p>

<p>"It was, indeed; there was slaughter
enough on land," said Harold; "and though
we were pretty confident that victory would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
perch upon our banners in the sea fight, we
could not hope it would prove so nearly
bloodless for our side."</p>

<p>"The sea fight?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that on the land was harder on our
fellows, particularly because our unreasonable
Congressmen had failed to furnish for
them the smokeless powder and Mauser bullets
that gave so great an advantage to the
Spaniards."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said the Captain, "that absolute
freedom from smoke made it impossible
to tell exactly whence came those stinging
darts that struck men down, and the great
penetrating power of the Mauser bullet made
them doubly deadly. They would cut through
a palm-tree without losing anything of their
force, and, in several instances, two or more
men were struck down by one and the same
missile."</p>

<p>"It was very sad that that gallant young
soldier, Captain Capron, was killed by that
first volley," remarked Violet.</p>

<p>"Yes," said her mother, "I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
reading the account of his death, and that he
came of a family of soldiers; that his father,
engaged with his battery before the Spanish
lines, left it for a brief time and came over
to where the body of his son lay on the rank
grass, and, looking for a moment on the still
features, stooped and kissed the dead face,
saying, 'Well done, boy, well done.' That
was all, and he went back to the battle."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother," said Harold, in moved
tones, "my heart aches yet when I think of
that poor, bereaved but brave father. Ah,
war is a dreadful thing, even when undertaken
from the good motive which influenced
our people, who felt so much sympathy for
the poor, abused Cubans."</p>

<p>"The Americans are, as a rule, kind-hearted
folk," remarked Mr. Lilburn, "and
I doubt if there are any troops in the world
superior to them in action; not even those of
my own land."</p>

<p>"No," said the Captain, "they were brave
fellows and good fighters, having seen service
in our Northwest and Southwest, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
prairies, among the mountains and on the
Mexican frontier, so that war was no new
thing to them, and they went about it calmly
even in so unaccustomed a place as a tropical
forest."</p>

<p>"Papa, that Captain Capron wasn't instantly
killed by that Mauser bullet, was
he?" asked Grace.</p>

<p>"No; he was struck down early in the action
and knew that his wound was mortal,
but he called to a man near him to give him
the rifle that lay by the side of a dead soldier;
then, propped up against a tree, he
fired at the enemy with it until his strength
failed, when he fell forward to die."</p>

<p>"What a brave fellow! It is dreadful to
have such men killed," said Grace, her voice
trembling with emotion.</p>

<p>"Another man, Private Heffener, also
fought leaning against a tree until he bled
to death," said Harold. "Then there was
Trooper Rowland, a cowboy from New Mexico,
who was shot through the lungs early in
that fight. He said nothing about it, but kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
his place on the firing-line till Roosevelt noticed
the blood on his shirt and sent him to
the hospital. He was soon back again and
seeing him Colonel Roosevelt said, 'I
thought I sent you to the hospital.' 'Yes,
sir; you did,' replied Rowland, 'but I didn't
see that they could do much for me there,
so I came back.' He stayed there until the
fight ended. Then he went again to the hospital.
Upon examining him the doctors decided
that he must be sent back to the States,
with which decision he was greatly disgusted.
That night he got possession of his
rifle and pack, slipped out of the hospital,
made his way back to his command and stayed
there."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Grandma Elsie, "you
have not all read Marshall's experiences then
and there. It happens that I have just been
re-reading an extract which has interested
me greatly. Let me read it aloud that you
may all have the benefit of it. It is a description
of the scene in the field hospital
where badly wounded men lay crowded together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
awaiting their turns under the surgeon's
knife. Shall I read it?"</p>

<p>There was a universal note of assent from
her hearers, and she began.</p>

<p>"There is one incident of the day which
shines out in my memory above all others
now, as I lie in a New York hospital, writing.
It occurred at the field hospital. About
a dozen of us were lying there. A continual
chorus of moans rose through the tree-branches
overhead. The surgeons, with
hands and bared arms dripping, and clothes
literally saturated, with blood, were straining
every nerve to prepare the wounded for
the journey down to Siboney. Behind me
lay Captain McClintock, with his lower leg-bones
literally ground to powder. He bore
his pain as gallantly as he had led his men,
and that is saying much. I think Major
Brodie was also there. It was a doleful
group. Amputation and death stared its
members in their gloomy faces.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, a voice started softly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'My country, 'tis of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet land of liberty,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of thee I sing.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Other voices took it up:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Land where my fathers died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Land of the Pilgrims' pride&mdash;&mdash;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The quivering, quavering chorus, punctuated
by groans and made spasmodic by
pain, trembled up from that little group of
wounded Americans in the midst of the Cuban
solitude&mdash;the pluckiest, most heartfelt
song that human beings ever sang. There
was one voice that did not quite keep up with
the others. It was so weak that I did not
hear it until all the rest had finished with the
line:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Let Freedom ring.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Then, halting, struggling, faint, it repeated
slowly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Land&mdash;of&mdash;the&mdash;Pilgrims'&mdash;pride,<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>
<p>"The last word was a woeful cry. One
more son had died as died the fathers."</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause when Grandma
Elsie had finished reading, and there
were tears in the eyes of many of her hearers.</p>

<p>It was Harold who broke the silence.</p>

<p>"That battle of Guasimas was a complete
victory for our forces, but dearly paid for,"
he said; "of the nine hundred and sixty-four
men engaged, sixteen were killed and fifty-two
wounded; thirty-four of the wounded
and eight of the killed were Rough Riders."</p>

<p>"And a scarcity of doctors seems to have
caused great suffering to our wounded men,"
Grandma Elsie said, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Yes; there were too few of us," said Harold,
"and, through somebody's blundering,
needed supplies were also scarce. I think
our men were wonderfully patient, and it is
hard to forgive those whose carelessness and
inefficiency caused them so much unnecessary
suffering."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," said his mother; "war is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
dreadful thing. How the people of beleaguered
Santiago suffered during the siege,
and especially when they were sent out of it
that they might escape the bombardment.
Think of eighteen to twenty thousand having
to take refuge in that little town, El Caney,
foul with the effluvium from unburied mules
and horses, and even human victims of the
battle; houses so crowded that they could not
even lie down on the floors, but had to pass
their nights sitting on them; and food so
scarce that one small biscuit sold for two
dollars, and seven dollars was refused for a
chicken."</p>

<p>"It was dreadful, dreadful indeed!" said
Mrs. Lilburn.</p>

<p>"Yet not so bad as it would have been to
let Spain continue her outrageous cruelty to
the poor Cubans," said Evelyn.</p>

<p>"No," said Lucilla, "I should be sorry, indeed,
to have to render up the account that
Weyler and the rest of them will in the Judgment
Day."</p>

<p>"I think he is worse than a savage," sighed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Mrs. Lilburn. "I should think if he had any
heart or conscience he would never be able to
enjoy a morsel of food for thinking of the
multitude of poor creatures&mdash;men, women
and children&mdash;he has starved to death."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> friends were favored with pleasant
weather on their voyage from Porto Rico to
Cuba. All were gathered upon deck when
they came in sight of "The Pearl (or Queen)
of the Antillies," "The Ever-faithful Isle,"
as the Spaniards were wont to call it, and
they gazed upon it with keen interest; an
interest that deepened as they drew near the
scene of Schley's victory over the Spanish
fleet.</p>

<p>Captain Raymond and Dr. Harold Travilla,
being the only ones of their number
who had visited the locality before, explained
the whereabouts of each American vessel,
when, on that Sunday morning of July third,
that cloud of smoke told the watchers on the
American ships that the enemy was coming
out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Every one in the little company had heard
the battle described; therefore, a very brief
account, accompanying the pointing out of
the progress of different vessels during the
fight, and where each of the Spanish ones
came to her end, was all that was needed.</p>

<p>While they looked and talked, the "Dolphin"
moved slowly along that they might get
a view of every part of the scene of action on
that day of naval victory in the cause of the
down-trodden and oppressed Cubans.</p>

<p>That accomplished, they returned to the
neighborhood of Santiago, and entering the
narrow channel which gives entrance to its
bay, passed on into and around that, gazing
on the steep hills that come down to the water's
edge, on Morro and the remains of
earthworks and batteries.</p>

<p>They did not care to go into the city, but
steamed out into the sea again and made the
circuit of the island, keeping near enough to
the shore to get a pretty good view of most of
the places they cared to see&mdash;traveling by
day and anchoring at night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Having completed the circuit of Cuba,
where do we go next, Captain?" asked Mr.
Dinsmore, as the party sat on deck in the
evening of the day on which they had completed
their trip around the island.</p>

<p>"If it suits the wishes of all my passengers,
we will go down to Jamaica, pay a little
visit there, pass on in a southeasterly direction
to Trinidad, then perhaps to Brazil,"
Captain Raymond said, in reply, then asked
to hear what each one present thought of the
plan.</p>

<p>Every one seemed well pleased, and it was
decided that they should start the next morning
for Jamaica. The vessel was moving the
next morning before many of her passengers
were out of their berths. Elsie Raymond
noticed it as soon as she woke, and hastened
with her toilet that she might join her father
on deck. She was always glad to be with
him, and she wanted to see whatever they
might pass on their way across the sea to Jamaica.
The sun was shining, but it was still
early when she reached the deck, where she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
found both her father and eldest sister. Both
greeted her with smiles and caresses.</p>

<p>"Almost as early a bird as your sister Lu,"
the Captain said, patting the rosy cheek and
smiling down into the bright eyes looking up
so lovingly into his.</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, I want to see all I can on the
way to Jamaica. Will we get there to-day?"</p>

<p>"I think we will if the 'Dolphin' does her
work according to her usual fashion. But
what do you know about Jamaica, the island
we are bound for?"</p>

<p>"Not so very much, papa&mdash;only&mdash;she belongs
to England, doesn't she, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Her name means 'land of wood
and water,' and she lies about ninety miles
to the south of Cuba."</p>

<p>"Is she a very big island, papa?"</p>

<p>"Nearly as large as our State of Tennessee.
Crossing it from east to west is a heavily-timbered
ridge called the Blue Mountains,
and there are many streams of water
which flow from them down to the shores.
None of them is navigable, however, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the Black River, which affords a passage for
small craft for thirty miles into the interior."</p>

<p>"Shall we find a good harbor for our 'Dolphin,'
father?" asked Lucilla.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! Excellent harbors are
everywhere to be found. The best is a deep,
capacious basin in the southeast quarter of
the island. It washes the most spacious and
fertile of the plains between the hill country
and the coast. Around this inlet and within
a few miles of each other are all the towns of
any considerable size&mdash;Spanish Town, Port
Royal, and Kingston."</p>

<p>"Is it a very hot place, papa?" asked the
little girl.</p>

<p>"On the coast; but much cooler up on those
mountains I spoke of. The climate is said
to be very healthful, and many invalids go
there from our United States."</p>

<p>"They have earthquakes there sometimes,
have they not, father?" asked Lucilla.</p>

<p>"They are not quite unheard of," he replied;
"in 1692 there was one which almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
overwhelmed Port Royal; but that being
more than two hundred years ago, need not,
I think, add much to our anxieties in visiting
the island."</p>

<p>"That's a long, long time," said Elsie,
thoughtfully, "so I hope they won't have one
while we are there. Is it a fertile island,
papa? I hope they have plenty of good
fruits."</p>

<p>"They have fruits of both tropical and
temperate climates; they have spices, vanilla
and many kinds of food plants; they have
sugar and coffee; they export sugar, rum,
pineapples and other fruits; also cocoa,
ginger, pimento and logwood and cochineal."</p>

<p>"It does seem to be very fruitful," said
Elsie. "Have they railroads and telegraphs,
papa?"</p>

<p>"Two hundred miles of railroad and seven
hundred of telegraph. There are coast batteries,
a volunteer force and a British garrison;
and there are churches and schools."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, all that seems very nice! I hope we
will have as good a time there as we had at
Bermuda."</p>

<p>"I hope so, daughter," he said. "Ah, here
come the rest of our little family and your
Uncle Harold."</p>

<p>Affectionate good-mornings were exchanged;
then the talk ran on the subject
uppermost in all their minds&mdash;Jamaica, and
what its attractions were likely to be for
them.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking," said Harold, "that
some spot on the central heights may prove
a pleasant and beneficial place for some
weeks' sojourn for all of us, the ailing ones
in particular."</p>

<p>At that moment his mother joined them
and he broached the same idea to her.</p>

<p>"If we find a pleasant and comfortable
lodging place I am willing to try it," she replied,
in her usual cheery tones.</p>

<p>At that moment came the call to breakfast;
speedily responded to by all the passengers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Appetites and viands were alike good
and the chat was cheerful and lively.</p>

<p>The weather was clear and warm enough
to make the deck, where a gentle breeze could
be felt, the most agreeable lounging-place, as
well as the best, for enjoying the view of the
sea and any passing vessel.</p>

<p>As usual, the children presently found
their way to their Grandma Elsie's side and
asked for a story or some information concerning
the island toward which they were
journeying.</p>

<p>"You know something about it, I suppose?"
she said, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am; papa was telling me this
morning about the mountains and towns,
and harbors, and fruits and other things
that they raise," said Elsie; "but there
wasn't time for him to tell everything; so
won't you please tell us something of its
history?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; grandma is always glad to
give you both pleasure and information. Jamaica
was discovered by Columbus during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
his second voyage, in 1494. The Spaniards
took possession of it in 1509."</p>

<p>"Had they any right to, grandma?" asked
Ned.</p>

<p>"No, no more than the Indians would have
had to cross the ocean to Europe and take
possession of their country. And the Spaniards
not only robbed the Indians of their
lands but abused them so cruelly that it is
said that in fifty years the native population
had entirely disappeared. In 1655 the
British took the island from Spain, and some
years later it was ceded to England by the
treaty of Madrid in 1670."</p>

<p>"And does England own it yet, grandma?"
asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes; there has been some fighting on the
island&mdash;trouble between the whites and the
negroes&mdash;but things are going smoothly
now."</p>

<p>"So that we may hope to have a good time
there, I suppose," said Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think we may," replied his grandma.
"But haven't we had a good time in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
our journeying about old ocean and her
islands?"</p>

<p>To that question both children answered
with a hearty, "Yes indeed, grandma."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning found the "Dolphin"
lying quietly at anchor in the harbor in the
inlet around which are the principal towns
of the island&mdash;Spanish Town, Port Royal
and Kingston.</p>

<p>All were well enough to enjoy little excursions
about the island, in carriages or cars,
and some weeks were spent by them in the
mountains, all finding the air there very
pleasant and the invalids evidently gaining
in health and strength.</p>

<p>The change had been a rest to them all,
but early in March they were glad to return
to the yacht and set sail for Trinidad, which
they had decided should be their next halting
place. It was a pleasant morning and, as
usual, old and young were gathered upon the
deck, the two children near their grandmother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Grandma," said Elsie, "I suppose you
know all about Trinidad, where papa is taking
us now, and if it won't trouble you to do
so, I'd like very much to have you tell Ned
and me about it."</p>

<p>"I shall not feel it any trouble to do so,
little granddaughter," was the smiling rejoinder,
"and if you and Ned grow weary of
the subject before I am through, you have
only to say so and I will stop.</p>

<p>"Trinidad is the most southerly of the
West India Islands and belongs to Great
Britain. It was first discovered by Columbus
in 1498 and given the name of Trinidad
by him, because three mountain summits
were first seen from the masthead. But it
was not until 1532 that a permanent settlement
was made there. In 1595 its chief
town, San Josede Oruha, was burned by Sir
Walter Raleigh; but the island continued in
Spain's possession till 1797, when it fell into
the hands of the British and it was made
theirs by treaty in 1802."</p>

<p>"How large is it, grandma?" asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"About fifty miles long and from thirty
to thirty-five wide. It is very near to
Venezuela, separated from it by the Gulf of
Paria, and the extreme points on the west
coast are only the one thirteen and the other
nine miles from it. The channel to the north
is called the Dragon's Mouth; it is the deepest;
the southern channel is shallow, owing
to the deposits brought down by the Orinoco,
and the gulf, too, is growing more shallow
from the same cause."</p>

<p>"Are there mountains, grandma?" asked
Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes; mountains not so high as those on
some of the other Caribbean islands; they
extend along the northern coast from east to
west; they have forests of stately trees and
along their lower edges overhanging mangroves,
dipping into the sea. There is a
double-peaked mountain called Tamana, and
from it one can look down upon the lovely
and fertile valleys and plains of the other
part of the island. There are some tolerably
large rivers and several good harbors."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are there towns on it, grandma?" asked
Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes; the chief one, called Port of Spain,
is one of the finest towns in the West Indies.
It was first built of wood, and was burned
down in 1808, but has since been rebuilt
of stone found in the neighborhood. The
streets are long, wide, clean, well paved and
shaded with trees.</p>

<p>"San Fernando is the name of another
town, and there are, besides, two or three
pretty villages. Near one of them, called
La Brea, is a pitch lake composed of bituminous
matter floating on fresh water."</p>

<p>"I don't think I'd want to take a sail on
it," said Elsie. "Trinidad is a warm place,
isn't it, grandma?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the climate is hot and moist; it is
said to be the hottest of the West India
islands."</p>

<p>"Then I'm glad it is winter now when
we are going there."</p>

<p>"Yes; I think winter is the best season for
paying a visit there," said her grandma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose we are going to one of the
towns," said Ned. "Aren't we, papa?" as
his father drew near.</p>

<p>"Yes, to the capital, called Port of Spain.
I was there some years ago. Shall I tell you
about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes sir! please do," answered both
children, and a number of the grown people
drew near to listen.</p>

<p>"It is a rather large place, having some
thirty or forty thousand inhabitants. Outside
of the town is a large park, where there
are villas belonging to people in good circumstances.
They are pleasant, comfortable-looking
dwellings with porches and porticoes,
gardens in front or lawns with many varieties
of trees&mdash;bread-fruit, oranges, mangoes,
pawpaws&mdash;making a pleasant shade
and bearing delightful fruits; and there is a
great abundance of flowers."</p>

<p>"All that sounds very pleasant, Captain,"
said Mr. Lilburn, "but I fear there
must be some unpleasant things to encounter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mosquitoes, for instance?" queried the
Captain. "Yes, I remember Froude's description
of one that he says he killed and
examined through a glass. Bewick, with the
inspiration of genius, had drawn his exact
likeness as the devil&mdash;a long black stroke for
a body, a nick for a neck, horns on the head,
and a beak for a mouth, spindle arms, and
longer spindle legs, two pointed wings and
a tail. He goes on to say that he had been
warned to be on the lookout for scorpions,
centipedes, jiggers, and land crabs, which
would bite him if he walked slipperless over
the floor in the dark. Of those he met none;
but the mosquito of Trinidad was enough by
himself, being, for malice, mockery, and
venom of tooth and trumpet, without a match
in the world."</p>

<p>"Dear me, papa, how can anybody live
there?" exclaimed Grace.</p>

<p>"Froude speaks of seeking safety in tobacco-smoke,"
replied her father, with a quizzical
smile. "You might do that; or try the
only other means of safety mentioned by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
him&mdash;hiding behind the lace curtains with
which every bed is provided."</p>

<p>"But we can't stay in bed all the time,
papa," exclaimed Elsie.</p>

<p>"No, but most of the time when you are
out of bed you keep off the mosquitoes with
a fan."</p>

<p>"And if we find them quite unendurable
we can sail away from Trinidad," said
Violet.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we are coming to the island at a
better time of the year than Froude did, as
regards the mosquito plague," remarked
Grandma Elsie.</p>

<p>"Ah, mother, I am afraid they are bad and
troublesome all the year round in these warm
regions," said Harold.</p>

<p>"But we can take refuge behind nets a
great deal of the time while we are in the
mosquito country, and hurry home when we
tire of that," remarked Violet.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is a comfortable thought," said
Mr. Lilburn. "And we are fortunate people
in having such homes as ours to return to."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, we can all say amen to that," said
Chester, and Lucilla started the singing of
"Home, Sweet Home," all the others joining
in with feeling.</p>

<p>The next morning found the "Dolphin"
lying quietly in the harbor of the Port of
Spain in the great shallow lake known as the
Gulf of Paria, and soon after breakfast all
went ashore to visit the city.</p>

<p>They enjoyed walking about the wide,
shaded streets, and park, gazing with great
interest upon the strange and beautiful trees,
shrubs and flowers; there were bread-fruit
trees, pawpaws, mangoes and oranges, and
large and beautiful flowers of many colors.
Some of our friends had read Froude's account
of the place and wanted to visit it.</p>

<p>From there they went to the Botanical
Gardens and were delighted with the variety
of trees and plants entirely new to them.</p>

<p>Before entering the place, the young
people were warned not to taste any of the
strange fruits, and Grandma Elsie and the
Captain kept watch over them lest the warning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
should be forgotten or unheeded; though
Elsie was never known to disobey father or
mother, and it was a rare thing, indeed, for
Ned to do so. They were much interested
in all they saw, the glen full of nutmeg trees
among the rest; they were from thirty to
forty feet high, with leaves of brilliant green,
something like the leaves of an orange,
folded one over the other, and their lowest
branches swept the ground. There were so
many strange and beautiful trees, plants and
flowers to be seen and admired that our
friends spent more than an hour in those
gardens.</p>

<p>Then they hired conveyances and drove
about wherever they thought the most attractive
scenes were to be found. They were
interested in the cabins of the negroes spread
along the road on either side and overhung
with trees&mdash;tamarinds, bread-fruit, orange,
limes, citrons, plantains and calabash trees;
out of the last named they make their cups
and water-jugs.</p>

<p>There were cocoa-bushes, too, loaded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
purple or yellow pods; there were yams in
the garden, cows in the paddocks also; so
that it was evident that abundance of good,
nourishing, appetizing food was provided
them with very little exertion on their part.</p>

<p>Captain Raymond and his party spent
some weeks in Trinidad and its harbor&mdash;usually
passing the night aboard the "Dolphin"&mdash;traveling
about the island in cars or
carriages, visiting all the interesting spots,
going up into the mountains and enjoying the
view from thence of the lovely, fertile valleys
and plains. Then they sailed around the
island and anchored again in the harbor of
Port of Spain for the night and to consider
and decide upon their next movement.</p>

<p>"Shall we go up the Orinoco?" asked the
Captain, addressing the company, as all sat
together on the deck.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, each waiting
for the others to speak, then Mr. Dinsmore
said: "Give us your views on the subject,
Captain. Is there much to attract us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
there? To interest and instruct? I am really
afraid that is a part of my geography in
which I am rather rusty."</p>

<p>"It is one of the great rivers of South
America," said the Captain. "It rises in one
of the chief mountain chains of Guiana. It
is a crooked stream&mdash;flowing west-south-west,
then south-west, then north-west, then north-north-east
and after that in an eastward direction
to its mouth. The head of uninterrupted
navigation is seven hundred and
seventy-seven miles from its mouth. Above
that point there are cataracts.</p>

<p>"It has a great many branches, being
joined, it is said, by four hundred and thirty-six
rivers and upward of two thousand
streams; so it drains an area of from two
hundred and fifty thousand to six hundred
and fifty thousand square miles, as variously
estimated. It begins to form its delta one
hundred and thirty miles from its mouth, by
throwing off a branch which flows northward
into the Atlantic. It has several navigable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
mouths, and the main stream is divided by a
line of islands, into two channels, each two
miles wide. The river is four miles wide at
Bolivar, a town more than two hundred and
fifty miles from the mouth of the river,
which is there three hundred and ninety feet
deep."</p>

<p>"Why, it's a grand, big river," said Chester.
"Much obliged for the information,
Captain. I had forgotten, if I ever knew,
that it was so large, and with its many tributaries
drained so large a territory."</p>

<p>"And do you wish to visit it&mdash;or a part of
it?" queried the Captain. "How is it with
you, Cousins Annis and Ronald?"</p>

<p>"I am willing&mdash;indeed, should prefer&mdash;to
leave the decision to other members of our
party," replied Mrs. Lilburn, and her husband
expressed the same wish to let others
decide the question.</p>

<p>"What do you say, Grandma Dinsmore?"
asked Violet. "I think you look as if you
would rather not go."</p>

<p>"And that is how I feel&mdash;thinking of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
mosquitoes," returned the old lady, with a
slight laugh.</p>

<p>"They certainly are very objectionable,"
said the Captain. "I can't say that I am at
all desirous to try them myself. And I doubt
if they are more scarce on the Amazon than
on the Orinoco. One traveler there tells us,
'At night it was quite impossible to sleep for
mosquitoes; they fell upon us by myriads,
and without much piping came straight to
our faces as thick as raindrops in a shower.
The men crowded into the cabins and tried
to expel them by smoke from burnt rags, but
it was of little avail, though we were half
suffocated by the operation.'"</p>

<p>"That certainly does not sound very encouraging,
my dear," said Violet.</p>

<p>"The Amazon is a grand river, I know,"
said Harold, "but it would not pay to visit
it under so great a drawback to one's comfort;
and I am very sure encountering such
pests would be by no means beneficial to any
one of my patients."</p>

<p>"And this one of your patients would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
be willing to encounter them, even if such
were the prescription of her physician," remarked
Grace, in a lively tone.</p>

<p>"Nor would this older one," added Grandma
Elsie, in playful tones.</p>

<p>"Then we will consider the Orinoco as tabooed,"
said the Captain; "and I suppose we
shall have to treat the Amazon in the same
way, as it was at a place upon its banks
that one of the writers I just quoted had
his most unpleasant experience with the mosquitoes."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, if there is a difference of
opinion and choice among us&mdash;some preferring
scenery even with mosquitoes, others
no scenery unless it could be had without
mosquitoes&mdash;suppose we divide our forces&mdash;one
set land and the other remain on board
and journey on up the river."</p>

<p>"Ah! and which set will you join, little
wife?" he asked, with playful look and tone.</p>

<p>"Whichever one my husband belongs to,"
she answered. "Man and wife are not to be
separated."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suppose we take a vote on the question
and settle it at once," said Lucilla.</p>

<p>"A good plan, I think," said Harold.</p>

<p>"Yes," assented the Captain. "Cousins
Annis and Ronald, please give us your
wishes in regard to rivers and mosquitoes."</p>

<p>"I admire the rivers, but not the mosquitoes,
and would rather do without both
than have both," laughed Annis, and her
husband added, "And my sentiments on the
subject coincide exactly with those of my
wife."</p>

<p>Then the question went round the circle,
and it appeared that every one thought a
sight of the great rivers and the scenery on
their banks would be too dearly purchased by
venturing in among the clouds of blood-thirsty
mosquitoes.</p>

<p>"I'm glad," exclaimed Ned; "for I'm not
a bit fond of mosquitoes; especially not of
having them take their meals off me. But
I'd like to see those big rivers. Papa, won't
you tell us something about the Amazon?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Captain; "it has two other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
names&mdash;Maranon and Orellana. It is a very
large river and has a big mouth&mdash;one hundred
and fifty miles wide, and the tide enters
there and goes up the stream five hundred
miles.</p>

<p>"From the wide mouth of the Amazon,
where it empties into the ocean, its water can
be distinguished from the other&mdash;that of the
ocean&mdash;for fifty leagues. The Amazon is so
large and has so many tributaries that it
drains two million, five hundred square miles
of country. The Amazon is the king of
rivers. It rises in the western range of the
Andes, and is little better than a mountain
torrent till it has burst through the gorges of
the eastern range of the chain, where it is
overhung by peaks that tower thousands of
feet above its bed. But within three hundred
miles from the Pacific is a branch, Huallagais,
large enough and deep enough for
steamers, and a few miles farther down the
Amazon is navigable for vessels drawing five
feet; and it grows deeper and deeper and
more and more available for large vessels as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
it rolls on toward the ocean. The outlet of
this mighty river is a feeder of the Gulf
Stream. It is only since 1867 that the
navigation of the Amazon has been open,
but now regular lines of steamers ply between
its mouth and Yurimaguas on the
Huallaga."</p>

<p>"Are there not many and important exports
sent down the Amazon?" asked Mr.
Dinsmore.</p>

<p>"There are, indeed," replied the Captain,
"and the fauna of the waters have proved
wonderful. Agassiz found there, in five
months, thirteen hundred species of fish,
nearly a thousand of them new, and about
twenty new genera. The Vacca marina, the
largest fish inhabiting fresh waters, and the
Acara, which carries its young in its mouth,
when there is danger, are the denizens of the
Amazon."</p>

<p>"Oh," exclaimed Elsie, "I'd like to see
that fish with its babies in its mouth."</p>

<p>"And I should be very sorry to have to
carry my children in that way&mdash;even if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
relative sizes of my mouth and children
made it possible," said her mother.</p>

<p>"Brazil's a big country, isn't it, papa?"
asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes," said his father; "about as large as
the United States would be without Alaska."</p>

<p>"Did Columbus discover it, and the Spaniards
settle it, papa?" he asked.</p>

<p>"In the year 1500 a companion of Columbus
landed at Cape Augustine, near Pernambuco,
and from there sailed along the coast
as far as the Orinoco," replied the Captain.
"In the same year another Portuguese commander,
driven to the Brazilian coast by adverse
winds, landed, and taking possession in
the name of his monarch named the country
Terra da Vera Crux. The first permanent
settlement was made by the Portuguese in
1531 on the island of St. Vincent. Many
settlements were made and abandoned, because
of the hostility of the natives and the
lack of means, and a Huguenot colony, established
on the bay of Rio de Janeiro, in
1555, was broken up by the Portuguese in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
1567 when they founded the present capital,
Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>"But it is hardly worth while to rehearse
all the history of the various attempts to take
possession of Brazil&mdash;attempts made by
Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish. French invasion
of Portugal, in 1807, caused the royal
family to flee to Brazil, and it became the
royal seat of government until 1821, when
Dom John VI. went back to Portugal, leaving
his eldest son, Dom Pedro, as Prince Regent.</p>

<p>"The independence of Brazil was proclaimed
September 7, 1822; and on October
12th, he was crowned emperor as Dom Pedro
I. He was arbitrary, and that made him so
unpopular that he found it best to abdicate,
which he did in 1831 in favor of his son,
then only a child. That boy was crowned in
1841, at the age of fifteen, as Dom Pedro
II."</p>

<p>"Gold is to be found in Brazil, is it not,
papa?" asked Grace.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "that country is rich in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
minerals and precious stones. Gold, always
accompanied with silver, is found in many of
the provinces, and in Minas-Geraes is especially
abundant, and in that and two other
of the provinces, diamonds are found; and
the opal, amethyst, emerald, ruby, sapphire,
tourmaline, topaz and other precious stones
are more or less common."</p>

<p>"Petroleum also is obtained in one or two
of the provinces, and there are valuable phosphate
deposits on some of the islands," remarked
Mr. Dinsmore, as the Captain
paused, as if he had finished what he had to
say in reply to Grace's question.</p>

<p>"Papa," asked Ned, "are there lions and
tigers and monkeys in the woods?"</p>

<p>"There are dangerous wild beasts&mdash;the
jaguar being the most common and formidable.
And there are other wild, some of them
dangerous, beasts&mdash;the tiger cat, red wolf,
tapir, wild hog, Brazilian dog, or wild fox,
capybara or water hog, paca, three species of
deer, armadillos, sloths, ant-eaters, oppossums,
coatis, water-rats, otters and porcupines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Squirrels, hares and rabbits are
plentiful. There are many species of monkeys,
too, and several kinds of bats&mdash;vampires
among them. On the southern plains, large
herds of wild horses are to be found. Indeed,
Brazil can boast a long list of animals. One
writer says that he found five hundred species
of birds in the Amazon valley alone,
about thirty distinct species of parrots and
twenty varieties of humming-birds. The
largest birds are the ouira, a large eagle; the
rhea, or American ostrich; and the cariama.
Along the coasts or in the forest are to be
found frigate birds, snowy herons, toucans,
ducks, wild peacocks, turkeys, geese and
pigeons. Among the smaller birds are the
oriole, whippoorwill and the uraponga, or
bell bird."</p>

<p>"Those would be pleasant enough to
meet," said Violet, "but there are plenty of
most unpleasant creatures&mdash;snakes, for instance."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented the Captain; "there are
many serpents; the most venomous are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
jararaca and the rattlesnake. The boa-constrictor
and anaconda grow very large,
and there are at least three species of cobra
noted as dangerous. There are many alligators,
turtles and lizards. The rivers, lakes
and coast-waters literally swarm with fish.
Agassiz found nearly two thousand species,
many of them such as are highly esteemed
for food."</p>

<p>"And they have big mosquitoes, too, you
have told us, papa," said Elsie. "Many other
bugs, too, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes; big beetles, scorpions and spiders,
many kinds of bees, sand-flies and musical
crickets, destructive ants, the cochineal
insect and the pium, a tiny insect
whose bite is poisonous and sometimes dangerous."</p>

<p>"Please tell us about the woods, papa,"
said Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes; the forests of the Amazon valley are
said to be the largest in the world, having
fully four hundred species of trees. In
marshy places and along streams reeds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
grasses and water plants grow in tangled
masses, and in the forests the trees crowd
each other and are draped with parasitic
vines. Along the coasts mangroves, mangoes,
cocoas, dwarf palms, and the Brazil-wood are
noticeable. In one of the southern provinces
more than forty different kinds of trees are
valuable for timber. On the Amazon and
its branches there are an almost innumerable
variety of valuable trees; among them the
itauba or stonewood, so named for its durability;
the cassia, the cinnamon-tree, the
banana, the lime, the myrtle, the guava, the
jacaranda or rosewood, the Brazilian bread-fruit,
whose large seeds are used for food,
and many others too numerous to mention;
among them the large and lofty cotton-tree,
the tall white-trunked seringa or rubber-tree,
which furnishes the gum of commerce, and
the three or four hundred species of palms.
One of those is called the carnaubu palm;
it is probably the most valuable, for every
part of it is useful, from the wax of its
leaves to its edible pith. Another is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
piassaba palm, whose bark is clothed with a
loose fiber used for coarse textile fabrics and
for brooms."</p>

<p>"Why, papa, that's a very useful tree,"
was little Elsie's comment upon that bit of
information. "Are there fruits and flowers
in those forests, papa?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; those I have already mentioned,
with figs, custard-apples and oranges. Some
European fruits&mdash;olives, grapes and water-melons
of fine flavor are cultivated in
Brazil."</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for the fierce wild animals
and snakes, it would be a nice country to
live in, I think," she said; "but taking everything
into consideration I very much prefer
our own country."</p>

<p>"Ah, is that so? Who shall say that
you won't change your mind after a few
weeks spent in Brazil?" returned her father,
with an amused look.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't want me to, I know, papa,"
she returned, with a pleasant little laugh,
"for I am very sure you want your children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to love their own country better than any
other in the world."</p>

<p>"Yes, my child, I do," he said. Then
turning to his older passengers and addressing
them in general, "I think," he said, "if
it is agreeable to you all, we will make a little
stop at Par&aacute;, the maritime emporium of the
Amazon. I presume you would all like to
see that city?"</p>

<p>All seemed pleased with the idea, and it
was presently settled that that should be their
next stopping-place. They all enjoyed their
life upon the yacht, but an occasional halt
and visit to the shore made an agreeable
variety.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Their</span> sail about the mouth of the Amazon
was very interesting to them all, and that up
the Par&aacute; River to the city of the same name,
not less so. They found the city evidently a
busy and thriving place; its harbor, formed
by a curve of the River Par&aacute;, here twenty
miles wide, had at anchor in it a number of
large vessels of various nationalities. The
"Dolphin" anchored among them, and after
a little her passengers went ashore for a drive
about the city.</p>

<p>They found the streets paved and macadamized,
the houses with white walls and
red-tiled roofs. There were some large and
imposing buildings&mdash;a cathedral, churches
and the President's palace were the principal
ones. They visited the public square and
beautiful botanic garden.</p>

<p>It was not very late in the day when they
returned to their yacht, but they&mdash;especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Dr. Harold's patients&mdash;were weary enough
to enjoy the quiet rest to be found in their
ocean home.</p>

<p>"What a busy place it is," remarked
Grandma Elsie, as they sat together upon the
deck, gazing out upon the city and its harbor.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Captain, "Par&aacute; is the mart
through which passes the whole commerce of
the Amazon and its affluents."</p>

<p>"And that must, of course, make it a place
of importance," said Violet.</p>

<p>"It was the seat of revolution in 1833,"
remarked her grandfather; "houses were destroyed,
lives lost&mdash;a great many of them&mdash;and
grass grew in streets which before that
had been the center of business."</p>

<p>"Papa," exclaimed Ned, "there's a little
boat coming, and a man in it with some little
animals."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes; small monkeys, I think they
are," Captain Raymond said, taking a view
over the side of the vessel.</p>

<p>Then he called to a sailor that he wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the man allowed to come aboard with whatever
he had for sale. In a few moments he
was at hand carrying two little monkeys in
his arms. He approached the Captain and
bowing low, hat in hand, addressed him in
Portuguese, first saying, "Good-evening,"
then going on to tell that these were fine little
monkeys&mdash;tee-tees&mdash;which he had brought
for sale, and he went on to talk fluently in
praise of the little creatures, which were
about the size of a squirrel, of a greyish-olive
as to the hair of body and limbs, a rich
golden hue on the latter; on the under surface
of the body a whitish grey, and the tip
of the tail black.</p>

<p>"Oh, how pretty, how very pretty!" exclaimed
little Elsie. "Papa, won't you buy
me one?"</p>

<p>"Yes, daughter, if you want it," returned
the Captain, "for I know you will be kind to
it and that it will be a safe and pretty pet for
you."</p>

<p>"And Oh, papa, I'd like to have the other
one, if I may!" cried Ned, fairly dancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
with delight at the thought of owning the
pretty little creature.</p>

<p>The Captain smiled and said something to
the man, speaking in Portuguese, a language
spoken and understood by themselves only
of all on board the vessel.</p>

<p>The man answered, saying, as the Captain
afterward told the others, that he was very
glad to sell both to one person, because the
little fellows were brothers and would be
company for each other.</p>

<p>Then a tee-tee was handed to each of the
children, the Captain gave the man some
money, which seemed to please him, and he
went away, while Elsie and Ned rejoiced
over and exhibited their pets, fed them and
gave them a comfortable sleeping-place for
the night.</p>

<p>"What lovely, engaging little things they
are!" said Grandma Elsie, as the children
carried them away, "the very prettiest monkeys
I ever saw."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Captain, "they are of a
very pretty and engaging genus of monkeys;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
we all noticed the beauty of their fur, from
which they are called callithrix or 'beautiful
hair.' Sometimes they are called squirrel
monkeys, partly on account of their shape
and size, and partly from their squirrel-like
activity. They are light, graceful little creatures.
I am hoping my children will have
great pleasure with theirs. They are said to
attach themselves very strongly to their possessors,
and behave with a gentle intelligence
that lifts them far above the greater part of
the monkey race."</p>

<p>"I think I have read that they are good-tempered,"
said Grandma Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes; they are said to be very amiable,
anger seeming to be almost unknown to
them. Did you not notice the almost infantile
innocence in the expression of their countenances?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," she replied; "it was very
touching, and made me feel an affection for
them at once."</p>

<p>"I have read," said Evelyn, "that that is
very strong when the little creatures are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
alarmed. That sudden tears will come into
their clear hazel eyes, and that they will
make a little imploring, shrinking gesture
quite irresistible to kind-hearted, sympathetic
people."</p>

<p>"I was reading about the tee-tees not long
ago," said Mrs. Lilburn; "and one thing I
learned was that they had a curious habit of
watching the lips of those who speak to them,
just as if they could understand the words
spoken, and that when they become quite familiar,
they are fond of sitting on their
friend's shoulder, and laying their tiny fingers
on his lips; as if they thought in that
way they might discover the mysteries of
speech."</p>

<p>"Poor little darlings! I wish they could
talk," exclaimed Grace. "I daresay they
would make quite as good use of the power of
speech as parrots do."</p>

<p>"Possibly even better," said her father.
"They seem to be more affectionate."</p>

<p>"Do they live in flocks in their own forests,
papa?" Grace asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "so the traveler, Mr.
Bates, tells us, and that when on the move
they take flying leaps from tree to tree."</p>

<p>"I am very glad you bought those, papa,"
she said. "I think they will be a pleasure
and amusement to us all."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Lucilla, "they are so pretty
and graceful that I think we will all be inclined
to pet them."</p>

<p>"So I think," said her father, "they seem
to me decidedly the prettiest and most interesting
species of monkey I have ever met
with."</p>

<p>"And it is really pleasant to see how delighted
the children are with their new pets,"
said Grandma Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes," the Captain responded, with a
pleased smile, "and I have no fear that they
will ill-use them."</p>

<p>"I am sure they will be kind to them,"
said Violet. "They were much interested in
the monkeys we saw in going about the city.
I saw quite a number of various species&mdash;some
pretty large, but most of them small;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
some at the doors or windows of houses, some
in canoes on the river."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think we all noticed them," said
her mother.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Captain, "I saw several of
the <i>midas ursulus</i>, a small monkey which I
have read is often to be found here in Par&aacute;.
It is, when full grown, only about nine inches
long, exclusive of the tail, which is fifteen
inches. It has thick black fur with a reddish
brown streak down the middle of the back.
It is said to be a timid little thing, but when
treated kindly becomes very tame and familiar."</p>

<p>"What do monkeys eat, papa?" asked
Grace.</p>

<p>"I have been told the little fellows are
generally fed on sweet fruits, such as the
banana, and that they are also fond of grasshoppers
and soft-bodied spiders."</p>

<p>"They have some very large and busy ants
in this country, haven't they, father?" asked
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Captain. "Bates tells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of some an inch and a quarter long and stout
in proportion, marching in single file
through the thickets. They, however, have
nothing peculiar or attractive in their habits,
though they are giants among ants. But he
speaks of another and far more interesting
species. It is a great scourge to the Brazilians,
from its habit of despoiling the most
valuable of their cultivated trees of their
foliage. In some districts it is such a pest
that agriculture is almost impossible. He
goes on to say that in their first walks they
were puzzled to account for mounds of earth
of a different color from the surrounding
soil; mounds, some of them very extensive,
some forty yards in circumference, but
not more than two feet high. But on making
inquiries they learned that those mounds
were the work of the saubas&mdash;the outworks
and domes which overlie and protect the entrances
to their vast subterranean galleries.
On close examination, Bates found the earth
of which they were made to consist of very
minute granules heaped together with cement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
so as to form many rows of little ridges and
turrets. And he learned that the difference
in color from the earth around was because
of the undersoil having been brought up
from a considerable depth to form these
mounds."</p>

<p>"I should like to see the ants at work upon
them," said Grace.</p>

<p>"It is very rarely that one has the opportunity
to do so," said her father. "Mr. Bates
tells us that the entrances are generally
closed galleries, opened only now and then
when some particular work is going on. He
says he succeeded in removing portions of
the dome in smaller hillocks, and found that
the minor entrances converged, at the depth
of about two feet, to one broad, elaborately-worked
gallery or mine, which was four or
five inches in diameter."</p>

<p>"Isn't it the ant that clips and carries
away leaves?" asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Yes, Bates speaks of that; says it has
long been recorded in books on natural history,
and that when employed on that work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
their procession looks like a multitude of
animated leaves on the march. In some
places he found an accumulation of such
leaves, all circular pieces about the size of
sixpence, lying on the pathway, no ants near
it, and at some distance from the colony.
'Such heaps,' he says, 'are always found to
have been removed when the place is revisited
the next day. The ants mount the trees
in multitudes. Each one is a working miner,
places itself on the surface of a leaf, and cuts
with its sharp, scissors-like jaws, and by a
sharp jerk detaches the leaf piece. Sometimes
they let the leaf drop to the ground,
where a little heap accumulates until carried
away by another relay of workers; but generally
each marches off with the piece he has
detached. All take the same road to their
colony and the path they follow becomes, in
a short time, smooth and bare, looking like
the impression of a cart-wheel through the
herbage.'"</p>

<p>"I am sorry the children have missed all
this interesting information," said Violet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind, my dear," said her husband,
"it can be repeated to them to-morrow. I
think there is a storm gathering, and that we
are likely to have to stay at home here for a
day or two."</p>

<p>"Should it prove a storm of any violence
we may be thankful that we are in this good,
safe harbor," remarked Mr. Dinsmore.</p>

<p>"And that we have abundance of good
company and good reading matter," added
Grandma Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes," responded her father, "those are
truly additional causes for thankfulness."</p>

<p>"The little monkeys are another," laughed
Lucilla. "I think we will have some fun
with them; and certainly the children are
delighted with their new pets."</p>

<p>"They certainly are engaging little creatures&mdash;very
different from those we are accustomed
to see going about our streets with
organ-grinders," said Grandma Dinsmore.</p>

<p>The children were on deck unusually early
the next morning, their pets with them. They
found their father, mother, Eva and Lucilla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
there. The usual affectionate morning greetings
were exchanged; then, smiling down
upon Elsie and her pet, the Captain said,
"I think you have not yet tired of your new
pet, daughter?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, papa," was the quick, earnest
rejoinder, "I'm growing fonder of him every
hour. Oh, he's just the dearest little fellow!"</p>

<p>"And so is mine," added Ned. "I think
I'll name him Tee-tee; and as Elsie's is a
little smaller than this, she is going to call
him Tiny."</p>

<p>"If papa approves," added Elsie.</p>

<p>"I am well satisfied," returned their father.
"You have begun your day rather earlier
than usual," Captain Raymond went on,
addressing the two children, "and I am well
pleased that it is so, because now you can
take some exercise about the deck, which may
be prevented later by a storm," and he
glanced up at the sky, where black clouds
were gathering.</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, we will," they answered, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
set off at once upon a race round the deck,
carrying their pets with them.</p>

<p>The storm had begun when the summons
to breakfast came, but the faces that gathered
about the table were cheerful and bright, the
talk also. All agreed that it would be no
hardship to have to remain on board for some
days with plenty of books and periodicals to
read, the pleasant company which they were
to each other, and the abundance of fruits
and other dainties which the Captain always
provided.</p>

<p>When they were done eating, they repaired
to the saloon, held their usual morning
service, then sat about singly or in
groups, talking, reading, writing, or, if a
lady, busied with some fancy work.</p>

<p>The children were much taken up with
their new pets, fondling them and letting
them climb about their shoulders.</p>

<p>Cousin Ronald watched them with interest
and pleasure. Elsie was standing near,
her Tiny on her shoulder, gazing into her
eyes with a look that seemed to say, "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
are so kind to me that I love you already."
Elsie stroked and patted him, saying, "You
dear little pet! I love you already, and mean
to take the very best care of you."</p>

<p>"Thanks, dear little mistress. I am glad
to belong to you and mean to be always the
best little tee-tee that ever was seen." The
words seemed to come from the tee-tee's lips,
and its pretty eyes were looking right into
Elsie's own.</p>

<p>"Why, you little dear!" she said, with a
pleased little laugh, stroking and patting
him, then glancing round at Cousin Ronald,
"How well you talk. In English, too, though
I don't believe you ever heard the language
before you came aboard the 'Dolphin.'"</p>

<p>"No, we didn't, though we can speak it
now as well as any other," Ned's pet seemed
to say, lifting its head from his shoulder and
glancing around at its brother.</p>

<p>That brought a merry laugh from its little
master. "Speak it as much as you please,
Tee-tee," he said, fondling his pet, "or talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Portuguese or any other language you're acquainted
with."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid they will never be able to talk
unless Cousin Ronald is in the company,"
said Elsie; "or Brother Max," she added, as
an after-thought.</p>

<p>"Yes, Brother Max could make them talk
just as well," said Ned. "Oh, here come the
letters and papers!" as a sailor came in
carrying the mailbag.</p>

<p>Its contents gave employment to every one
for a time, but, after a little, Violet, having
finished the perusal of her share, called the
children to her and gave them an interesting
account of the talk of the night before about
the strange doings of South American ants.
They were much interested, and asked a
good many questions. When that subject was
exhausted, Elsie asked to be told something
about Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>"There is a maritime province of that
name in the south-east part of Brazil," her
mother said. "I have read that in the southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
part of it the scenery is very beautiful.
The middle of the province is mountainous.
About the city I will read you from the "New
International Encyclopedia," which your father
keeps on board whenever we are using
the yacht."</p>

<p>She took down the book, opened and read:
"'Rio de Janeiro, generally called Rio, the
capital of the Brazilian empire, and the
largest and most important commercial emporium
of South America, stands on a magnificent
harbor, seventy-five miles west of
Cape Frio. The harbor or bay of Rio de
Janeiro, said, and apparently with justice, to
be the most beautiful, secure, and spacious
bay in the world, is land-locked, being entered
from the south by a passage about a
mile in width. It extends inland seventeen
miles, and has an extreme breadth of about
twelve miles. Of its numerous islands, the
largest, Governor's Island, is six miles long.
The entrance of the bay, guarded on either
side by granite mountains, is deep, and is so
safe that the harbor is made without the aid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of pilots. On the left of the entrance rises
the peak called, from its peculiar shape,
Sugarloaf Mountain; and all round the bay
the blue waters are girdled with mountains
and lofty hills of every variety of picturesque
and fantastic outline. The harbor is protected
by a number of fortresses. The city
stands on the west shore of the bay, about
four miles from its mouth. Seven green and
mound-like hills diversify its site; and the
white-walled and vermillion-roofed houses
cluster in the intervening valleys, and climb
the eminences in long lines. From the central
portion of the city, lines of houses extend
four miles in three principal directions.
The old town, nearest the bay, is laid out in
squares; the streets cross at right angles, are
narrow, and are paved and flagged; and the
houses, often built of granite, are commonly
two stories high. West of it is the elegantly-built
new town; and the two districts are
separated by the Campo de Santa Anna, an
immense square or park, on different parts
of which stand an extensive garrison, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
town-hall, the national museum, the palace of
the senate, the foreign office, a large opera
house, etc. From a number of springs which
rise on and around Mount Corcovado (three
thousand feet high, and situated three and a
half miles southwest of the city) water is
conveyed to Rio de Janeiro by a splendid
aqueduct, and supplies the fountains with
which the numerous squares are furnished.
Great municipal improvements have, within
recent years, been introduced; most of the
streets are now as well paved as those of the
finest European capitals; the city is abundantly
lighted with gas; and commodious
wharfs and quays are built along the water
edge. Rio de Janeiro contains several excellent
hospitals and infirmaries, asylums for
foundlings and female orphans, and other
charitable institutions, some richly endowed;
about fifty chapels and churches,
generally costly and imposing structures,
with rich internal decorations, and several
convents and nunneries. In the College of
Pedro II., founded in 1837, the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
branches of a liberal education are efficiently
taught by a staff of eight or nine professors;
the Imperial Academy of Medicine, with a
full corps of professors, is attended by upward
of three hundred students; there is also
a theological seminary. The national library
contains one hundred thousand volumes.'</p>

<p>"There, my dears, I think that is all that
will interest you," concluded Violet, closing
the book.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> storm continued for some days, during
which the "Dolphin" lay quietly at anchor
in the bay of Par&aacute;. It was a quiet, uneventful
time for her passengers, but they enjoyed
themselves well in each other's society and
waited patiently for a change of weather.</p>

<p>Finally it came; the sun shone, the waves
had quieted down and a gentle breeze taken
the place of the boisterous wind of the last
few days.</p>

<p>Just as the sun rose, the anchor was lifted
and, to the joy of all on board, the yacht went
on her way, steaming out of the harbor and
then down the coast of Brazil; a long voyage,
but, under the circumstances, by no means
unpleasant to the "Dolphin's" passengers, so
fond as they were of each other's society.</p>

<p>At length they arrived at Rio de Janeiro.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
They stayed there long enough to acquaint
themselves with its beauties and all that
might interest a stranger.</p>

<p>All that accomplished, they left for the
north, as it was getting near the time when
even the invalids might safely return to the
cooler climate of that region.</p>

<p>It was evening; the children had retired
for the night, and all the older ones were together
on the deck. A silence that had lasted
for some moments was broken by Lucilla.
"You are taking us home now, I suppose,
father?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember to have said so," replied
the Captain, pleasantly, "though very
likely I may do so if you all wish it."</p>

<p>Then Violet spoke up in her quick, lively
way, "Mamma, if you would give us all an
invitation to visit Viamede, I think it would
be just delightful to go there for a week or
two; and then Chester could see his sisters
and their children."</p>

<p>"I should be glad to help him to do so; and
very glad to have you all my guests at Viamede,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
was the reply, in Grandma Elsie's
own sweet tones.</p>

<p>Then came a chorus of thanks for her invitation;
all seeming much pleased with the
idea.</p>

<p>"It will be quite a journey," remarked
Lucilla, in a tone of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You are not weary of life on shipboard,
daughter?" her father queried, with a
pleased little laugh.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, father; I am very fond of life
on the 'Dolphin.' I suppose that's because
of the sailor-blood in me inherited from
you."</p>

<p>"Some of which I have also," said Grace;
"for I dearly love a voyage in the 'Dolphin.'"</p>

<p>"Which some of the rest of us do without
having the excuse of inherited sailor-blood,"
said Harold.</p>

<p>"No; that inheritance isn't at all necessary
to the enjoyment of life on the 'Dolphin,'"
remarked Chester.</p>

<p>"Indeed, it is not," said Evelyn. "I am a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
landsman's daughter, but life on this vessel
with the dear friends always to be found on
it is delightful to me."</p>

<p>"And the rest of us can give a like testimony,"
said Mrs. Lilburn, and those who had
not already spoken gave a hearty assent.</p>

<p>"Up this South American coast, through
the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico&mdash;it
will be quite a voyage," remarked Lucilla,
reflectively. "It is well, indeed, that we are
all fond of life on the 'Dolphin.'"</p>

<p>"Yes; you will have had a good deal of it
by the time we get home," said her father.</p>

<p>"To-morrow is Sunday," remarked Grandma
Elsie. "I am very glad we can have services
on board. I often find them quite as
helpful as those I attend on shore."</p>

<p>"Yes; I don't know why we shouldn't have
services, though there is no licensed preacher
among us," said the Captain. "Certainly, we
may all read God's Word, talk of it to others,
and address to him both prayers and praises."</p>

<p>The next morning after breakfast all assembled
upon deck, united in prayer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
praise, the Captain read a sermon, and then
Mr. Lilburn, by request of the others, led
them in their Bible lesson.</p>

<p>"Let us take parts of the 13th and 14th
chapters of Numbers for our lesson to-day,"
he said, reading the passages aloud, then
asked, "Can you tell me, Cousin Elsie, where
the children of Israel were encamped just at
that time?"</p>

<p>"At Kadesh, in what was called the wilderness
of Paran. It was at a little distance to
the southwest of the southern end of the Dead
Sea."</p>

<p>"They went and searched the land, as Moses
directed, and cut down and brought back
with them a cluster of grapes, a very large
one, it must have been, for they bare it between
two upon a staff; also they brought
pomegranates and figs. Do you know, Neddie,
what Eshcol means?" asked Cousin
Ronald.</p>

<p>"No, sir; papa hasn't taught me that yet,"
replied the little boy.</p>

<p>"It means a bunch of grapes," said Cousin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Ronald, smiling kindly on the little fellow.
"Grace, do you think the spies were truthful?"</p>

<p>"They seem to have been, so far as the
facts about the country they had just visited
were concerned," Grace answered, then read,
"And they told him, and said, 'We came
unto the land whither thou sentest us, and
surely it floweth with milk and honey; and
this is the fruit of it. Nevertheless, the people
be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities
are walled, and very great; and, moreover,
we saw the children of Anak there. The
Amalekites dwell in the land of the south:
and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the
Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the
Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast
of Jordan.'"</p>

<p>"Truly, a very discouraging report," said
Mr. Lilburn; "for though they described the
land as very good and desirable, they evidently
considered its inhabitants too strong
to be overcome."</p>

<p>He then read, "And they brought up an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
evil report of the land which they had
searched unto the children of Israel, saying,
'The land, through which we have gone to
search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
thereof; and all the people that we saw
in it are men of a great stature. And there
we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which
come of the giants: and we were in our
own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were
in their sight.' And what effect had their
report upon the people, Cousin Violet?" he
asked.</p>

<p>In reply, Violet read, "And all the congregation
lifted up their voice, and cried; and
the people wept that night. And all the children
of Israel murmured against Moses and
against Aaron: and the whole congregation
said unto them, 'Would God that we had
died in the land of Egypt! Or would God
we had died in this wilderness! And wherefore
hath the Lord brought us unto this land,
to fall by the sword, that our wives and our
children should be a prey? Were it not better
for us to return into Egypt?' And they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
said, one to another, 'Let us make a captain,
and let us return into Egypt.'"</p>

<p>It seemed to be Mr. Dinsmore's turn, and
he read, "And Joshua, the son of Nun; and
Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, which were of
them that searched the land, rent their
clothes: And they spake unto all the company
of the children of Israel, saying, 'The land,
which we passed through to search it, is exceeding
good land. If the Lord delight in us,
then He will bring us into this land, and give
it us; a land which floweth with milk and
honey. Only rebel not ye against the Lord,
neither fear ye the people of the land; for
they are bread for us: their defense is departed
from them, and the Lord is with us:
fear them not.'"</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Dinsmore read, "But all the
congregation bade stone them with stones.
And the glory of the Lord appeared in the
tabernacle of the congregation before all the
children of Israel. And the Lord said unto
Moses, 'How long will this people provoke
me? And how long will it be ere they believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
me, for all the signs which I have showed
among them? I will smite them with the pestilence,
and disinherit them, and will make
of thee a greater nation and mightier than
they.'"</p>

<p>"How very childish they were," remarked
Violet. "Why should they wish they had died
in the land of Egypt, or in the wilderness?
That would have been no better than dying
where they were. And it does seem strange
they could not trust in God when he had
given them such wonderful deliverances."</p>

<p>"And they said, one to another, 'Let us
make a captain, and let us return into
Egypt,'" read Harold, adding, "It does seem
as though they felt that Moses would not do
anything so wicked and foolish as going back
into Egypt."</p>

<p>"And they might well feel so," said the
Captain. "Moses was not the man to be discouraged
by such difficulties after all the
wonders God had shown him and them in
Egypt and the wilderness."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Mr. Lilburn. "But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
let us go on to the end of the story. We have
read that the Lord threatened to smite them
with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and
make of Moses a greater nation and mightier
than they. Chester, what did Moses say in
reply?"</p>

<p>"And Moses said unto the Lord, 'Then the
Egyptians shall hear it (for Thou broughtest
up this people in Thy might from among
them); and they will tell it to the inhabitants
of this land; for they have heard that
Thou, Lord, art among this people, that
Thou, Lord, art seen face to face, and that
Thy cloud standeth over them, and that Thou
goest before them, by daytime in the pillar
of cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.
Now if Thou shalt kill all this people as one
man, then the nations which have heard the
fame of Thee will speak, saying, Because the
Lord was not able to bring this people into
the land which He sware unto them, therefore
He hath slain them in the wilderness.
And now, I beseech Thee, let the power of
my Lord be great, according as Thou hast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
spoken, saying, The Lord is long-suffering,
and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and
transgression, and by no means clearing the
guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children unto the third and fourth
generation. Pardon, I beseech Thee, the iniquity
of this people according unto the
greatness of Thy mercy, and as Thou hast
forgiven this people, from Egypt even until
now.'"</p>

<p>Chester paused, and Mrs. Dinsmore took
up the story where he dropped it, reading
from her Bible, "And the Lord said, 'I have
pardoned according to thy word: but as truly
as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the
glory of the Lord. Because all those men
which have seen My glory and My miracles,
which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness,
and have tempted me now these ten times,
and have not hearkened to My voice. Surely
they shall not see the land which I sware
unto their fathers, neither shall any of them
that provoked Me see it: But My servant
Caleb, because he had another spirit with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
him, and hath followed Me fully, him will I
bring into the land whereinto he went; and
his seed shall possess it. (Now the Amalekites
and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley).
To-morrow, turn you, and get you into the
wilderness by the Red Sea.'"</p>

<p>"Papa, did all those people lose their
souls?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"I hope not," he replied. "If they repented
and turned to the Lord, they were forgiven
and reached Heaven at last. Jesus says,
'Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take
My yoke upon you and learn of Me, for I
am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall
find rest unto your souls.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">"Are</span> we going to stop at any of these
South American countries, papa?" asked Elsie
the next day, standing by her father's
side on the deck.</p>

<p>"I hardly think so," he replied. "It is
rather too nearly time to go home."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, I'd like ever so much to see
our other home, Viamede&mdash;grandma lets me
call it one of my homes&mdash;if there is time, and
it isn't too far away."</p>

<p>"Well, daughter," her father said, with a
smile, "I think there is time, and the place
not too far away&mdash;the 'Dolphin' being a
good-natured yacht that never complains of
her long journeys."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, are we really going there?"
cried the little girl, fairly dancing with delight.
"I'll be so glad to see the Keith cousins
at the cottage, and those at Magnolia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Hall, and the others at Torriswood. And I'll
show Tiny to them, and they'll be sure to be
pleased to see him," she added, hugging her
pet, which, as usual, she had in her arms.</p>

<p>"Probably they will," said her father. "Do
you think of giving him to any one of them?"</p>

<p>"Give my little pet Tiny away? Why,
papa! no indeed! I couldn't think of such a
thing!" she cried, hugging her pet still closer.
"I'm fond of him, papa, and I'm pretty
sure he's fond of me; he seems to want to
snuggle up close to me all the time."</p>

<p>"Yes; I think he is fond of you and won't
want to leave you, except for a little while
now and then to run up and down the trees
and round the grounds. That will be his
play; and when he gets hungry he will go
back to you for something to eat."</p>

<p>Ned, with his pet in his arms, had joined
them just in time to hear his father's last
sentence.</p>

<p>"Are you talking about Elsie's Tiny,
papa?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, my son, and what I said will apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to your Tee-tee just as well. I think if my
children are good and kind to the little fellows
they will not want to run away."</p>

<p>"I have been good to him so far," said
Ned, patting and stroking his pet as he spoke,
"and I mean to keep on. Papa, where are we
going now? Elsie and I were talking about
it a while ago, and we wondered if we were
now on the way home."</p>

<p>"Would you like to be?" asked his father.</p>

<p>"Yes, papa; or to go somewhere else first;
just as pleases you."</p>

<p>"What would you say as to visiting Viamede?"</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, that I'd like it ever so much!"</p>

<p>"Well, your grandma has given us all an
invitation to go there, and we are very likely
to accept it. It will make us a little later in
getting home than I had intended, but it will
be so great a pleasure that I think we will all
feel paid."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" cried Ned, dancing up and
down in delight, "I think it's just splendid
that we can go there. I don't know any lovelier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
or more delightful place to go to; do
you, papa?"</p>

<p>"And I'm as glad as you are, Ned," said
Elsie. "Let's go and thank grandma. Yonder
she is in her usual seat under the awning."</p>

<p>"Yes," said their father, "you owe her
thanks, and it would be well to give them at
once," and they hastened to do his bidding.</p>

<p>Grandma Elsie was seated with the other
ladies of their party in that pleasant spot
under the awning, where there were plenty
of comfortable seats, and they were protected
from sun and shower. The gentlemen were
there, too. Some were reading and some&mdash;the
younger ones&mdash;chatting and laughing
merrily among themselves. Into this group
the children came rushing, full of excitement
and glee.</p>

<p>"Oh grandma," they cried, talking both at
once, "we're so glad we're going to Viamede,
so much obliged to you for inviting us, because
it's such a dear, beautiful place and
seems to be one of our homes."</p>

<p>"Yes, you must consider it so, my dears;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
because it is mine, and I consider my dear
grandchildren as mine, too," was grandma's
smiling, affectionate rejoinder.</p>

<p>"As I do, mamma," said Violet, "and I am
sure no children ever had a better, kinder
grandmother."</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said Elsie. "And I think
Tiny and Tee-tee will enjoy being at Viamede,
too, and climbing up the beautiful
trees. Papa says they will, but will be glad
to come back to us when they get hungry;
because we feed them with such things as
they like to eat."</p>

<p>"It will be a long journey before we get to
Viamede, won't it, mamma?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes; a good many miles up this coast of
South America, then through the Caribbean
Sea and the Gulf of Mexico to New Orleans,
then through Teche Bayou to Viamede. I
think it will be a long, pleasant journey.
Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma, it is very pleasant to be on
our yacht with you and papa and grandma
and so many other kind friends."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then the Captain joined them.</p>

<p>"How long will it take us to get to Viamede,
papa?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"About as long as it would to cross the
ocean from our country to Europe. And
should storms compel us to seek refuge for a
time in some harbor, it will, of course, take
longer."</p>

<p>"Will we go back to Trinidad?"</p>

<p>"Hardly, I think; though we will probably
pass in sight of the island."</p>

<p>"And we are on the coast of Brazil now?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and will be for a week or more."</p>

<p>"We are trying life in the 'Dolphin' for a
good while this winter," said Violet.</p>

<p>"You are not wearying of it, I hope, my
dear?" asked the Captain, giving her a rather
anxious and troubled look.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not at all!" she replied, giving
him an affectionate smile, "this winter trip
has been a real enjoyment to me thus far."</p>

<p>"As it has to all of us, I think," said her
mother; and all within hearing joined in
with their expressions of pleasure in all they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
had experienced on the sea or on the land
since sailing away from their homes in the
"Dolphin."</p>

<p>"I am half afraid that you gentlemen will
find your homes but dull places when you get
back to them," remarked Lucilla, in a tone
of feigned melancholy, sighing deeply as she
spoke.</p>

<p>"Well, for business reasons I shall be glad
to get back to my office," said Chester. "So
it will not be altogether a trying thing to return,
even if my home is to be but dull and
wearisome."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it will be," laughed Grace.
"Lu is never half so hard and disagreeable
as she pretends. She has always been the
nicest of sisters to me, and I have an idea
that she is quite as good a wife."</p>

<p>"So have I," said Chester. "I know I
wouldn't swap wives with any man."</p>

<p>"Nor I husbands with any woman,"
laughed Lucilla. "I took this man for better
or for worse, but there's no worse about it."</p>

<p>A merry laugh from little Elsie turned all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
eyes upon her. Tiny was curled up on her
shoulder, his hazel eyes fixed inquiringly
upon her face and one of his fingers gently
laid upon her lips.</p>

<p>"I think your Tiny is wanting to learn to
talk," her father said. "He seems to be trying
to see how you do it."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you think he can learn, papa?"
she asked, in eager tones. "I don't see why
monkeys shouldn't talk as well as parrots."</p>

<p>"I do not, either, my child; I only know
that they do not."</p>

<p>At that instant Tiny lifted his head and
turned his eyes upon the Captain, and some
words seemed to come rapidly and in rather
an indignant tone from his lips. "I can talk
and I will when I want to. My little mistress
is very kind and good to me, and I'm growing
very fond of her."</p>

<p>Everybody laughed and Elsie said, "I wish
it were really his talk. But I know it was
Cousin Ronald who spoke."</p>

<p>"Ah, little cousin, how much fun you miss
by knowing too much," laughed Mr. Lilburn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Ned's Tee-tee seemed to speak. "You
needn't make a fuss over my brother. I can
talk quite as well as he can."</p>

<p>"Why, so you can!" exclaimed Ned, stroking
and patting him. "And I'm glad to have
you talk just as much as you will."</p>

<p>"Thank you, little master; you're very
good to me," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Now, Tiny, it is your turn," said Elsie
to her pet. "I hope you think you are having
a good time here on this yacht?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed I do," was the reply. "But
where are we going?"</p>

<p>"To Viamede; a beautiful place in Louisiana.
And you shall run about over the velvety,
flower-spangled lawn, and climb the
trees, if you want to, and pick some oranges
and bananas for yourself, and have ever such
a good time."</p>

<p>"That's nice! Shall my brother Tee-tee
have a good time with me, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you both promise not to run away
and leave us."</p>

<p>"We'd be very foolish tee-tees if we did."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"So I think," laughed Elsie, affectionately
stroking and patting Tiny.</p>

<p>"Come, Tee-tee; it's your turn to talk a
little," said Ned, patting and stroking his
pet.</p>

<p>"Am I going to that good place Tiny's
mistress tells about, where they have fine
trees to climb and oranges and bananas and
other good things to eat?" Tee-tee seemed to
ask.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Ned, "if you keep on being
a good little fellow you shall go there and
have a good time playing about and feasting
on the fruits, nuts and other nice things."</p>

<p>"Then I mean to be good&mdash;as good as I
know how."</p>

<p>"Cousin Ronald, you do make them talk
very nicely," remarked Elsie, with satisfaction,
adding, "But I do wish they could do
it themselves."</p>

<p>"I presume they would be glad if they
could," said Lucilla. "Yours watches the
movements of your lips, as if he wanted very
much to imitate them with his."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I believe he does," said Elsie. "It
makes me feel more thankful for the gift of
speech than I ever did before."</p>

<p>"Then it has a good effect," said her father.</p>

<p>"So they are useful little creatures, after
all," said Grace, "though I had thought them
only playthings."</p>

<p>"I think Tiny is the very best plaything
that ever I had," said Elsie, again stroking
and patting the little fellow. "Cousin Ronald,
won't you please make him talk a little
more?"</p>

<p>"Why do you want me to talk so much,
little mistress?" Tiny seemed to ask.</p>

<p>"Oh, because I like to hear you and you
really mean what you seem to say. Do you
like to be with us on this nice big yacht?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well, though I'd rather be among
the big trees in the woods where I was born."</p>

<p>"I think that must be because you are not
quite civilized," laughed Elsie.</p>

<p>"I'd rather be in those woods, too," Tee-tee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
seemed to say. "Let's run away to the
woods, Tiny, when we get a chance."</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" cried Ned, "if that's the way
you talk you shan't have a chance."</p>

<p>"Now, Ned, you surely wouldn't be so
cruel as to keep him if he wants to go back
to his native woods," said Lucilla. "How
would you like to be carried off to a strange
place, away from papa and mamma?"</p>

<p>"But I ain't a monkey," said Ned. "And
I don't believe he cares about his father and
mother as I do about mine. Do you care very
much about them, Tee-tee?"</p>

<p>"Not so very much; and I think they've
been caught or killed."</p>

<p>The words seemed to come from Tee-tee's
lips and Ned exclaimed, triumphantly:
"There; he doesn't care a bit."</p>

<p>"But it wasn't he that answered; it was
Cousin Ronald."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe Cousin Ronald knows how
he feels. Don't you, Cousin Ronald?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I must acknowledge that it is all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
guess-work, sonny boy," laughed the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"Well," said Ned, reflectively, "I've heard
there are some folks who are good at guessing,
and I believe you are one of them,
Cousin Ronald."</p>

<p>"But I'm not a Yankee, you know, and
I've heard that they are the folks who are
good at guessing," laughed Cousin Ronald.</p>

<p>"But I don't believe they do all the guessing;
I think other folks must do some of it,"
said Ned.</p>

<p>"Quite likely," said Cousin Ronald; "most
folks like to engage in that business once in
awhile."</p>

<p>"Tee-tee," said Ned, "I wish you and Tiny
would talk a little more."</p>

<p>"What about little master?" seemed to
come in quick response from Tiny's lips.</p>

<p>"Oh, anything you please. All I want is
the fun of hearing you talk," said Ned.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be polite for us to do all the
talking," he seemed to respond; and Ned returned,
"You needn't mind about the politeness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of it. We folks all want to hear you
talk, whatever you may say."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to talk unless I have
something to say," was Tiny's answer.</p>

<p>"That's right, Tiny; you seem to be a sensible
fellow," laughed Lucilla.</p>

<p>"Papa, are monkeys mischievous?" asked
Elsie.</p>

<p>"They have that reputation, and certainly
some have shown themselves so; therefore,
you would better not put temptation in the
way of Tiny or Tee-tee."</p>

<p>"And better not trust them too far," said
Violet. "I'd be sorry to have any of your
clothes torn up while we are so far from
home."</p>

<p>"Oh mamma, do you think they would do
that?" cried Elsie.</p>

<p>"I don't know; but I have heard of monkeys
meddling with their mistress's clothes,
and perhaps Tiny doesn't know how much
too large even yours would be for her&mdash;no for
him."</p>

<p>"Well, mamma, I'll try to keep things out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
of his way, and I hope he'll realize that a
girl's garments are not suitable for a boy
monkey," laughed Elsie. "Do you hear
that? and will you remember?" she asked,
giving him a little shake and tap which he
seemed to take very unconcernedly.</p>

<p>"And I'll try to keep my clothes out of
Tee-tee's way; for I shouldn't like to make
trouble for you, mamma, or to wear either
holey or patched clothes," said Ned.</p>

<p>"No," said his father; "so we will hope
the little fellows will be honest enough to
refrain from meddling with your clothes; at
least till we get home."</p>

<p>"And I think you will find these pretty
little fellows honest, and not meddlesome,"
said Mr. Dinsmore. "I have read that they
are most engaging little creatures, and from
what I have seen of these, I think that is
true; they seem to behave with gentle intelligence
quite superior to that of any other
monkey I ever saw; to have amiable tempers,
too, and there is an innocent expression in
their countenances, which is very pleasing. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
do not think they have as yet had anything
to frighten them here, but I have read that
when alarmed, sudden tears fill their clear
hazel eyes, and they make little imploring,
shrinking gestures that excite the sympathy
of those to whom they are appealing for protection."</p>

<p>"Yes, grandpa, I think they do look good,
enough better and pleasanter than any other
monkey that ever I saw," said Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes," said his father, "it is certainly the
most engaging specimen of the monkey family
that ever I came across."</p>

<p>"Children," said Violet, "the call to dinner
will come in about five minutes. So put
away your pets for the present and make
yourselves neat for the table."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> "Dolphin" sped on her way, and her
passengers enjoyed their voyage whether the
sun shone or the decks were swept by wind
and rain; for the saloon was always a comfortable
place of refuge in stormy weather,
and by no means an unpleasant one at any
time. They were all gathered on the deck
one bright, breezy morning, chatting cheerily,
the children amusing themselves with
their tee-tee pets.</p>

<p>"Father," said Lucilla, "are we not nearing
the Caribbean Sea?"</p>

<p>"Yes; if all goes well we will be in it by
this time to-morrow," was Captain Raymond's
reply. "It is a body of water worth
seeing; separated from the Gulf of Mexico by
Yucatan, and from the Atlantic Ocean by the
great arch of the Antilles, between Cuba and
Trinidad. It forms the turning point in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
vast cycle of waters known as the Gulf
Stream that wheels round regularly from
Southern Africa to Northern Europe. The
Caribbean Sea pours its waters into the Gulf
of Mexico on the west, which shoots forth on
the east the Florida stream with the computed
volume of three thousand Mississippis."</p>

<p>"But, papa, where does it get so much
water to pour out?" asked Elsie. "I wonder
it didn't get empty long ago."</p>

<p>"Ah, that is prevented by its taking in as
well as pouring out. It gathers water from
the Atlantic Ocean and the Amazon and
Orinoco rivers."</p>

<p>"Papa, why do they call it by that name&mdash;Caribbean
Sea?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"It takes its name from the Caribs, the
people who were living there when Columbus
discovered the islands," said the Captain.</p>

<p>"The Gulf Stream is very important, isn't
it, papa?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"The most important and best known of
the great ocean currents," he replied. "It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
flows out of the Gulf of Mexico, between
the coast of Florida on one side and the Cuba
and Bahama islands and shoals on the
other."</p>

<p>"The Stream is very broad, isn't it, papa?"
asked Grace.</p>

<p>"About fifty miles in the narrowest portion,
and it has a velocity of five miles an
hour; pouring along like an immense torrent."</p>

<p>"But where does it run to, papa?" asked
Ned.</p>

<p>"First in a northeasterly direction, along
the American coast, the current gradually
growing wider and less swift, until it reaches
the island and banks of Newfoundland; then
it sweeps across the Atlantic, and divides
into two portions, one turning eastward toward
the Azores and coast of Morocco, while
the other laves the shores of the British
islands and Norway, also the southern borders
of Iceland and Spitsbergen, nearly as
far east as Nova Zembla."</p>

<p>"But how can they tell where it goes when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
it mixes in with other waters, papa?" asked
Elsie.</p>

<p>"Its waters are of a deep indigo blue, while
those of the sea are light green," replied her
father. "And as it pours out of the Gulf of
Mexico its waters are very warm and full of
fish and seaweed in great masses. Its waters
are so warm that in mid-winter, off the cold
coasts of America between Cape Hatteras
and Newfoundland, ships beaten back from
their harbors by fierce northwesters until
loaded down with ice and in danger of foundering,
turn their prows to the east and seek
relief and comfort in the Gulf Stream."</p>

<p>"Don't they have some difficulty in finding
it, father?" asked Lucilla.</p>

<p>"A bank of fog rising like a wall, caused
by the condensation of warm vapors meeting
a colder atmosphere, marks the edge of the
Stream," replied the Captain. "Also the water
suddenly changes from green to blue, the
climate from winter to summer, and this
change is so sudden that when a ship is crossing
the line, a difference of thirty degrees of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
temperature has been marked between the
bow and the stern."</p>

<p>"Papa, I know there used to be pirates in
the West Indies; was it there that Kidd committed
his crimes?"</p>

<p>"I think not," replied her father. "In his
day, piracy on the high seas prevailed to an
alarming extent, especially in the Indian
Ocean. It was said that many of the freebooters
came from America, and that they
found a ready market here for their stolen
goods. The King of England&mdash;then King
of this country, also&mdash;wished to put an end
to piracy, and instructed the governors of
New York and Massachusetts to put down
these abuses.</p>

<p>"It was soon known in New York that the
new governor was bent on suppressing piracy.
Then some men of influence, who knew
of Kidd as a successful, bold and skilful
captain, who had fought against the French
and performed some daring exploits, recommended
him as commander of the expedition
against the pirates. They said he had all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
requisite qualifications&mdash;skill, courage, large
and widely-extended naval experience, and
thorough knowledge of the haunts of the pirates
'who prowled between the Cape of Good
Hope and the Straits of Malacca.'</p>

<p>"A private company was organized, a vessel
bought, called the 'Adventure,' equipped
with thirty guns, and Kidd given command.
He sailed to New York, and on his way captured
a French ship off the coast of Newfoundland.
He sailed from the Hudson
River in January, 1697, crossed the ocean
and reached the coast of Madagascar, then the
great rendezvous of the buccaneers."</p>

<p>"And how soon did he begin his piracy,
papa?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you exactly, but it soon began
to be reported that he was doing so, and in
November, 1698, orders were sent to all the
governors of English colonies to apprehend
him if he came within their jurisdiction.</p>

<p>"In April, 1699, he arrived in the West
Indies in a vessel called 'Quidah Merchant,'
secured her in a lagoon on the Island of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Samoa, southeast of Hayti, and then, in a
sloop called 'San Antonio,' sailed for the
north, up the coast into Delaware Bay, afterward
to Long Island Sound, and into Oyster
Bay. He was soon arrested, charged with
piracy, sent to England, tried, found guilty
and hung."</p>

<p>"There were other charges, were there not,
Captain?" asked Mr. Dinsmore.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; burning houses, massacring
peasantry, brutally treating prisoners, and
particularly with murdering one of his men,
William Moore. He had called Moore a dog,
to which Moore replied, 'Yes, I am a dog, but
it is you that have made me so.' At that,
Kidd, in a fury of rage, struck him down
with a bucket, killing him instantly. It was
found impossible to prove piracy against
Kidd, but he was found guilty of the murder
of Moore, and on the twenty-fourth of May,
1701, he was hanged with nine of his accomplices."</p>

<p>"Did he own that he was guilty, papa?"
asked Grace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," replied the Captain, "he protested
his innocence to the last; said he had been
coerced by his men, and that Moore was mutinous
when he struck him; and there are
many who think his trial was high-handed
and unfair."</p>

<p>"Then I hope he didn't deserve quite all
that has been said against him," said Grace.</p>

<p>"I hope not," said her father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Elsie</span> and Ned were on deck with their
pet tee-tees, which seemed to be in even more
than usually playful mood, running round
and round the deck and up and down the
masts. Ned chased after them, trying to catch
them, but failing again and again. He grew
more and more excited and less careful to
avoid mishap in the struggle to capture the
little runaways. Elsie called after him to
"let them have their fun for awhile, and then
they would come back to be petted and fed,"
but he paid no attention to her. He called
and whistled to Tee-tee, who was high up on
a mast. The little fellow stood still for a
time, regarding his young master as if he
would say, "I'll come when I please, but you
can't make me come sooner." So Ned read
the look, and called up to him, "Come down
this minute, you little rascal, or I'll be apt
to make you sorry you didn't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>That did not seem to have any effect, and
Ned looked about for some one to send up
after the little runaway.</p>

<p>"Have patience, master Ned, he'll come
down after a bit," said a sailor standing near.
"Ah, do you see? There he comes now," and
turning quickly, Ned saw his tee-tee running
swiftly down the mast, then along the
top of the gunwale, then down on the outside.
He rushed to catch him, leaned too far over,
and, with a cry of terror, felt himself falling
down, down into the sea.</p>

<p>A scream from Elsie echoed his cry. The
sailor who had spoken to Ned a moment before,
instantly tore off his coat and plunged
in after the child, caught him as he rose to
the surface, held him with his head out of
water, and called for a boat which was already
being launched by the other sailors.</p>

<p>Neither the Captain nor any of his older
passengers were on deck at the moment; but
the cries of the children, the sailor's plunge
into the water, and the hurrying of the others
to launch the boat were heard in the saloon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"Something is wrong!" exclaimed the
Captain, hurrying to the deck, closely followed
by Violet, whose cry was, "Oh, my
children! What has happened to them?"</p>

<p>The other members of the party came
hurrying after all in great excitement.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, my dear," said the
Captain, soothingly, "whatever is wrong can
doubtless be set right in a few moments."
Then, catching sight of his little girl as he
gained the deck, and seeing that she was crying
bitterly, "Elsie daughter, what is it?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa," sobbed the child, "Neddie has
fallen into the sea, and I'm afraid he's
drowned!"</p>

<p>Before her father could answer, a sailor
approached and, bowing respectfully, said:</p>

<p>"I think it will be all right, sir, in a few
minutes. Master Ned fell into the water, but
Tom Jones happened to be close at hand, and
sprang in right after him and caught him as
he came up the first time. Then he called
to us to lower the boat, and you see it's in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
water already, and they're starting after Master
Ned and Tom&mdash;left considerable behind
now by the forward movement of the yacht."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes; I see them," returned the Captain;
"the boat, too. Violet, my dear, Neddie
seems to be quite safe, and we will have
him on board again in a few minutes."</p>

<p>All on the deck watched, in almost breathless
suspense, the progress of the small boat
through the water, saw it reach and pick up
the half-drowning man and boy, and then return
to the yacht. In a few moments more
Ned was in his mother's arms, her tears falling
on his face, as she clasped him to her
bosom, kissing him over and over again with
passionate fondness.</p>

<p>"There, Vi, dear, you would better give
him into my care for a little," said Harold.
"He wants a good rubbing, dry garments, a
dose of something hot and then a good nap."</p>

<p>"There, go with Uncle Harold, dear," said
his mother, releasing him.</p>

<p>"And papa," said Ned, looking up at his
father, entreatingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, little son, papa will go with you," returned
the Captain, in moved tones.</p>

<p>"Oh, is my tee-tee drowned?" exclaimed
the little fellow, with sudden recollection,
and glancing around as he spoke.</p>

<p>"No," said Harold; "I see him now running
around the deck. He's all right." And
with that the two gentlemen hurried down
into the cabin, taking Ned with them.</p>

<p>"Well, it is a very good plan to always
take a doctor along when we go sailing about
the world," remarked Lucilla, looking after
them as they passed down the stairway.</p>

<p>"Yes; especially when you can find one as
skilful, kind and agreeable as our Doctor
Harold," said Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear," said Mrs. Travilla,
regarding Evelyn with a pleased smile,
"he seems to me both an excellent physician
and a polished gentleman; but mothers are
apt to be partial judges; so I am glad to find
that your opinion is much the same as mine."</p>

<p>Grace looked gratified, and Violet said:
"It seems to be the opinion of all on board."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mine as well as the rest," added Lucilla.
"Chester has improved wonderfully since we
set sail on the 'Dolphin.'"</p>

<p>"Quite true," said Chester's voice close at
hand, he having just returned from a talk
with the sailors who had picked up the half-drowning
man and boy, "quite true; and I
give credit to my doctor, Cousin Harold; for
his advice at least, which I have endeavored
to follow carefully. He's a fine, competent
physician, if it is a relative who says it.
Violet, you need have no fear that he won't
bring your boy through this thing all right."</p>

<p>"I am not at all afraid to trust him&mdash;my
dear, skilful brother and physician&mdash;and I
believe he will be able to bring my little son
through this trouble," said Violet.</p>

<p>"No doubt of it," returned Chester; "by
to-morrow morning little Ned will be in
usual health and spirits; none the worse for
his sudden sea bath."</p>

<p>"I can never be thankful enough to Tom
Jones," said Violet, with emotion. "He saved
the life of my darling boy; for he surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
would have drowned before any one else
could have got to him."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Chester; "I think he deserves
all the praise you can give him."</p>

<p>"And something more than praise," said
Violet and her mother, both speaking at
once. "He is not, by any means, a rich man,"
added Violet, "and my husband will certainly
find a way to help him into better circumstances."</p>

<p>"Something in which I shall be glad to
assist," added her mother. "Neddie is your
son, but he is my dear little grandson."</p>

<p>"And my great-grandson," added Mr.
Dinsmore, joining the group. "I am truly
thankful that Tom Jones was so near when
he fell, and so ready to go to the rescue."</p>

<p>"And the engineer to slacken the speed of
the vessel, the other sailors to lower and man
the boat and go to the rescue," said Violet.</p>

<p>"Yes; they must all be rewarded," said
her mother. "It will be a pleasure to me to
give them a substantial evidence of the gratitude
I feel."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is just like you, mamma," said Violet,
with emotion; "but I am sure his father
is able, and will be more than willing to do
all that is necessary."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" exclaimed Lucilla, "there
is no more just or generous person than my
father! And he is abundantly able to do all
that can be desired to reward any or all who
took any part in the saving of my dear little
brother."</p>

<p>"My dear girl," said Grandma Elsie, "no
one who knows your father can have the least
doubt of his generosity and kindness of
heart; I am very sure that all the men we
were speaking of will have abundant proof
of it."</p>

<p>"As we all are," said Mr. Dinsmore.</p>

<p>"I'm sure papa will do just what is right;
he always does," said little Elsie. "And oh,
mamma, don't you think that he and Uncle
Harold will soon get dear Neddie well of his
dreadful dip in the sea?"</p>

<p>"I do, daughter," answered Violet; "and
oh, here come your papa and uncle now!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>For at that moment the two gentlemen
stepped upon the deck and came swiftly toward
them.</p>

<p>"Oh? how is he&mdash;my darling little son?"
cried Violet, almost breathless with excitement
and anxiety.</p>

<p>"Doing as well as possible," answered her
brother, in cheery tone. "He has had a good
rubbing down, a hot, soothing potion, been
covered up in his berth, and fallen into a
sound sleep."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Captain, "I think he is
doing as well as possible, and to-morrow will
show himself no worse for his involuntary
dip in the sea."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad, so thankful!" exclaimed
Violet, tears of joy filling her eyes.</p>

<p>"As I am," said his father, his voice trembling
with emotion; "we have great cause for
thankfulness to the Giver of All Good. I am
very glad your mind is relieved, dearest. But
I must go now and thank the men, whose
prompt action saved us from a heavy loss and
bitter sorrow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>He had seated himself by Violet's side and
put his arm about her, but he rose with those
last words, and went forward to where a
group of sailors were talking over the episode
and rejoicing that it had ended so satisfactorily.
They lifted their hats and saluted
the Captain respectfully as he neared them.</p>

<p>"How is the little lad, sir?" asked Jones,
as he neared them. "No worse for his ducking,
I hope."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jones. I think he will not
be any the worse by to-morrow morning," replied
the Captain. "He is sleeping now,
which, I think, is the best thing he could do.
Jones, he owes his life to you, and I can
never cease to be grateful to you for your
prompt action in springing instantly to his
rescue when he fell into the water."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," stammered Jones, looking both
pleased and embarrassed, "it&mdash;it wasn't a bit
more than almost any other fellow would
have done in my place. And I'm mighty
glad I did it, for he's one o' the likeliest little
chaps ever I saw!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is a very dear one to his father and
mother, brother and sisters, and I should like
to give to each of you fellows who helped in
this thing, some little token of my appreciation
of your kindly efforts. I will think it
over and have a talk with you again, and you
may consider what return I could make that
would be the most agreeable and helpful to
you."</p>

<p>"About how much do you suppose that
means?" asked one man of his mates, when
the Captain had walked away.</p>

<p>"Perhaps five dollars apiece," chuckled
one of the others, "for the Captain is pretty
generous; and likely Jones's share will be
twice as much."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! who wants to be paid for saving
that cute little chap from drowning?"
growled Jones. "I'd have been a coward if
I'd indulged in a minute's hesitation."</p>

<p>"I s'pose so," returned one of the others,
"but you risked your life to save his, so deserve
a big reward, and I hope and believe
you'll get it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>On leaving the group of sailors, the Captain
went to the pilot-house and gave warm
thanks there for the prompt slowing of the
"Dolphin's" speed the instant the alarm of
Ned's fall was given.</p>

<p>"It was no more than any other man
would have done in my place, Captain,"
replied the pilot, with a smile of gratification.</p>

<p>"No," returned Captain Raymond, "some
men would have been less prompt and the
probable consequence, the loss of my little
son's life, which would have been a great loss
to his mother and me," he added, with emotion.
"I think you are worthy of an increase
of pay, Mr. Clark, and you won't object to
it, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; seeing I have a family to
support, I won't refuse your kindness,
and I thank you very much for the kind
offer."</p>

<p>At that moment Violet drew near and stood
at her husband's side. She spoke in tones
trembling with emotion. "I have come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
thank you, Clark, for the saving of my darling
boy's life; for I know that but for the
slowing of the engine both Jones and he
might have lost their lives&mdash;sinking before
help could reach them."</p>

<p>"You are very kind to look at it in that
way, Mrs. Raymond," returned Clark, in
tones that spoke his appreciation of her
grateful feeling, "but it was very little that
I did&mdash;cost hardly any exertion and no risk.
Jones is, I think, the only one deserving
much, if any, credit for the rescue of the
little lad."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, then added, "But
the Captain here has most generously offered
me an increase of pay; for which I thank
him most heartily."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, I am very glad to hear
that!" exclaimed Violet, addressing her husband.</p>

<p>With the last word, her hand was slipped
into his arm, and, with a parting nod to
Clark, they turned and went back to the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
group still gathered upon the deck under
the awning.</p>

<p>They found Elsie with Tiny on her shoulder
and Tee-tee on her lap.</p>

<p>"I must take care of them both now for
awhile till Ned gets over that dreadful sea
bath," she said, looking up smilingly at her
parents as they drew near.</p>

<p>"Yes, daughter, that is right," replied her
father, "it was no fault of little Tee-tee that
his young master fell into the sea."</p>

<p>That evening Violet and the Captain had
a quiet promenade on the deck together, in
which they talked of those who had any share
in the rescue of their little Ned, and what
reward might be appropriate for each one.</p>

<p>"I have heard there is a mortgage on the
farm which is the home of Tom Jones and
his mother," said the Captain. "I will pay
that off as my gift to Tom, in recognition of
his bravery and kindness in risking his own
life in the effort to save that of our little
son."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do," said Violet, joyfully; "he certainly
deserves it, and probably there is nothing he
would like better."</p>

<p>"He is certainly entitled to the largest reward
I give," said the Captain, "though I
daresay almost any of the others would have
acted just as he did, if they had had the same
opportunity."</p>

<p>Ned slept well under his uncle's care that
night, and the next morning appeared at the
breakfast table looking much as usual, and
saying, in answer to loving inquiries, that he
felt as if nothing had happened to him; not
a bit the worse for his bath in the sea.</p>

<p>Nor was he disposed to blame Tee-tee for
his involuntary plunge into the water; the
two were evidently as fast friends as ever.</p>

<p>After breakfast the Captain had a talk,
first with Jones, then with the other men, in
which each learned what his reward was to
be. Jones was almost too much moved for
speech when told of his, but expressed his
gratitude more fully afterward, saying, "It
is a blessed thing to have a home of one's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
own; especially when it can be shared with
one's mother. Dear me, but won't she be
glad!"</p>

<p>And the others were highly pleased with
the ten dollars apiece which fell to their
shares.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> yacht had now passed from the Caribbean
Sea into the Gulf of Mexico and was
headed for New Orleans, where they arrived
safely and in due season.</p>

<p>They did not care to visit the city&mdash;most
of them having been there several times, and
all wanting to spend at Viamede the few days
they could spare for rest and pleasure before
returning to their more northern homes. So
they tarried but a few hours at the Crescent
City, then pursued their way along the gulf,
up the bay into Teche Bayou and beyond
through lake and lakelet, past plantation and
swamp, plain and forest; enjoying the scenery
as of old&mdash;the beautiful velvety green
lawns, shaded by their magnificent oaks and
magnolias, cool shady dells carpeted with a
rich growth of flowers; tall white sugar-houses
and long rows of cabins for the laborers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and lordly villas peering through groves
of orange trees.</p>

<p>A pleasant surprise awaited them as they
rounded at the wharf&mdash;at Viamede; a great
gathering of friends and relatives&mdash;not only
from the immediate neighborhood, but from
that of their more northern homes&mdash;Edward
Travilla and his family, Elsie Leland and
hers, Rose Croly with her little one. It was
a glad surprise to Violet, for her mother had
not told her they had all been invited to
spend the winter at Viamede, and had accepted
the invitation.</p>

<p>The cousins from Magnolia Hall, Torriswood
and the cottage were all there. It
seemed a joyful meeting to all; to none more
so than to Chester and his sisters. It was
their first meeting since his marriage, and
they seemed glad to call Lucilla sister.</p>

<p>"You must be our guest at Torriswood,
Lu; you and Brother Chester," said Maud,
when greetings were over, and the new arrivals
were removing their hats in one of the
dressing-rooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, Maud, of course we will
spend a part&mdash;probably most of our time
with you," replied Lucilla. "I expect to
have a delightful time both there and here."</p>

<p>"You shall there, if I can bring it about,"
laughed Maud. "I want you also, young
Mrs. Raymond," she added, in playful tones,
turning to Evelyn. "You will come, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I think I shall," was Eva's
pleased reply.</p>

<p>"You are wanted, too, Gracie," continued
Maud. "And Dr. Harold is to be invited,
and I hope will accept, for he is a great favorite
with us ever since he saved Dick's
life."</p>

<p>"I think it entirely right that he should
be," returned Grace, demurely, "and his
presence will be no serious objection to me;
in fact, as he is my physician, it might be
very well to have him close at hand, in case
I should be taken suddenly ill."</p>

<p>"Very true," said Maud, bridling playfully,
"though if he were not there, Dr. Percival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
might possibly prove an efficient substitute."</p>

<p>There was a general laugh at that, and all
hastened to join the rest of the company who
were gathered upon the front veranda.</p>

<p>Elsie and Ned were there with their new
pets, which seemed to be attracting a good
deal of attention. Elsie was sitting by her
mother's side, with Tiny on her shoulder, and
Ned stood near them with Tee-tee in his
arms, stroking and patting him while he told
how the little fellow had frightened him in
his gambols about the yacht till, in trying
to save him from falling into the sea, he had
tumbled in himself.</p>

<p>"Very foolish in you to risk your life for
me, little master," Tee-tee seemed to say, as
Ned reached that part of his story. Ned
laughed, saying, "So you think, do you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it can talk! It can talk!" cried several
of the children in astonishment and delight,
while their elders turned with amused,
inquiring looks to Cousin Ronald, the known
ventriloquist of the family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, little master, so don't you do it ever
again," seemed to come from Tee-tee's lips.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, I think I won't," laughed
Ned.</p>

<p>"I can talk, too; quite as well as my
brother can," seemed to come from Tiny's
lips.</p>

<p>"Yes, so you can, my pretty pet," laughed
Elsie, giving him an approving pat.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh! They can both talk!" exclaimed
several of the children.</p>

<p>"And speak good English, too, though they
come from a land where it is not commonly
spoken," laughed Chester.</p>

<p>"But we heard English on the yacht, and
we can learn fast," was Tee-tee's answering
remark.</p>

<p>"Especially when you can get Cousin Ronald
to help you," laughed Ned.</p>

<p>"There, Ned, I'm afraid you've let the cat
out of the bag," laughed Lucilla.</p>

<p>"I don't see either cat or bag," sniffed
Ned, after an inquiring look around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your sister means that you are letting
out a secret," said his father.</p>

<p>"Oh, was I? I hope not," exclaimed the
little fellow, looking rather crestfallen.</p>

<p>"How does Cousin Ronald help him?"
asked one of the little cousins.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Ned; "I couldn't do
it."</p>

<p>The call to the supper-table just at that
moment saved Cousin Ronald the trouble of
answering the inquiring looks directed at
him.</p>

<p>After the meal, all resorted again to the
veranda, and the little tee-tees, having had
their supper in the kitchen, were again a
source of amusement, especially to the children.</p>

<p>"Did the folks give you plenty to eat, Tee-tee?"
asked Ned.</p>

<p>"All we wanted, and very nice, too," the
little fellow seemed to say in reply.</p>

<p>"And he ate like&mdash;like a hungry bear; a
great deal more than I did," Tiny seemed to
say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I'm bigger than you," was Tee-tee's
answering remark.</p>

<p>"And both of you are very, very little; too
little to eat much, I should think," laughed
one of the children.</p>

<p>"I've heard that they put the best goods
in the smallest packages," Tee-tee seemed to
say; then suddenly he sprang out of Ned's
arms, jumped over the veranda railing, ran
swiftly across the lawn and up an orange
tree, Tiny leaving Elsie and racing after
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, dear! What shall we do? Will
they ever come back?" cried Elsie, tears filling
her eyes as she spoke.</p>

<p>"I think they will, daughter," said the
Captain, soothingly. "Do you forget that I
told you they would run up the trees? You
and Ned have been so kind to them, petted
them and fed them so well that they'll be
glad, I think, to continue in your care, but
now, like children, they want a little fun,
such as they have been accustomed to in their
forest life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>That assurance comforted the young owners
somewhat, and they chatted pleasantly
with the other children until it was time for
them to leave, but kept watching the tee-tees
frisking about in that tree and others on the
lawn, hoping they would weary of their fun
and come back to them. But they had not
done so when the guests took leave, nor
when bedtime came, but the Captain comforted
the children again with the hope that
the tee-tees would finish their frolic and return
the next day; which they did, to the
great joy of their young master and mistress.</p>

<p>Maud's invitation was accepted by all to
whom she or Dick had given it. Magnolia
Hall and the Parsonage claimed several of
the others, and the rest were easily and well
accommodated at Viamede. All felt themselves
heartily welcome, and greatly enjoyed
their sojourn of some weeks in that hospitable
neighborhood and among near and dear
relatives.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Ned, his remark about
Cousin Ronald helping the tee-tees with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
talk, did not have the bad effect that he
feared, and the older friends did not explain;
so there was more fun of the same kind when
the children were together and the kind old
gentleman with them.</p>

<p>As the stay of Grandma Elsie and her party
was to be short, there was a constant interchange
of visits between them and the relatives
resident in the neighborhood, and much
to the delight of the children, the little tee-tees
were on constant exhibition. Sometimes
they were to be seen darting here and there
over the lawn, running up and down the trees
or springing from one to another; but often,
to the greater pleasure of the young folks,
they were on the veranda, chasing each other
round and round, or sitting on the shoulder
of Elsie or Ned. Then if Cousin Ronald
happened to be present, they seemed to be in
the mood for conversation.</p>

<p>"I like this place, Tiny, don't you?" Tee-tee
seemed to ask one day, when they had just
returned from a scamper over the lawn and
up and down the trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" was the reply. "It's nicer
than that vessel we came in. Let's stay here."</p>

<p>"Oh, we can't. I heard the Captain talking
about going back, and they'll certainly
want to take us along."</p>

<p>"But don't let us go. We can hide in the
woods where they can't find us."</p>

<p>"I think not," laughed Elsie; "we value
you too much not to hunt you up before we
go."</p>

<p>"Dear me! I'd take good care they didn't
get a chance to play that game," exclaimed
one of the little cousins.</p>

<p>"I think the best plan will be to pet them
so much that they won't be willing to be left
behind," said Elsie.</p>

<p>"And that's what we'll do," said Ned.</p>

<p>Just then there was an arrival from Torriswood
and that put a stop, for the time, to
the chatter of the Tee-tees.</p>

<p>Dr. Percival and his Maud, with their
guests from the north, were of the party, and
all remained until near bedtime that night,
when they went away with the pleasant assurance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
that the whole connection at that
time in that neighborhood would spend the
following day with them in their lovely Torriswood
home, should nothing occur to prevent.</p>

<p>Nothing did; the day was bright and beautiful,
and not one of the relatives was missing
from the pleasant gathering. To the joy of
Elsie and Ned Raymond, not even the tee-tees
were neglected in the invitation, and
with some assistance from Cousin Ronald
they made a good deal of fun, for at least the
younger part of the company.</p>

<p>The next day was spent by the same company
at Magnolia Hall, and a few days later
most of them gathered at the pretty Parsonage,
where dwelt Cyril and Isadore Keith.
Cyril was a much-loved and successful pastor,
an excellent preacher, whose sermons
were greatly enjoyed by those of the "Dolphin"
party who were old enough to appreciate
them.</p>

<p>The Parsonage and its grounds made a
lovely home for the pastor, his wife and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
children with which Providence had blessed
them, and the family party held there, the
last of the series, was found by all quite as
enjoyable as any that had preceded it.</p>

<p>After that the old pastimes&mdash;rides, drives,
boating and fishing excursions&mdash;were resumed,
also the quiet home pleasures and
rambles through the woods and fields; for
they found they could not tear themselves
away as quickly as they had intended when
they planned to end their winter trip&mdash;leaving
the return journey out of the calculation&mdash;with
a short visit to Viamede. That
neighborhood, with its pleasant companionship,
was too delightful to be left until the
increasing heat of the advancing spring
should make it less comfortable and healthful
for them than their more northern homes.
So there let us leave them for the present.</p>
